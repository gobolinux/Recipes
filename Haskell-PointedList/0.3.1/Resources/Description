[Name] Haskell-PointedList
[Summary] A zipper-like comonad which works as a list, tracking a position.
[Description] A PointedList tracks the position in a non-empty list which works similarly to a zipper. A current item is always required, and therefore the list may never be empty. A circular PointedList wraps around to the other end when progressing past the actual edge.

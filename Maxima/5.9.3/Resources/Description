[Name] Maxima 
[Summary] A computer algebra system
[License] GPL
[Description] Maxima is a system for the manipulation of 
symbolic and numerical expressions, including differentiation,
integration, Taylor series, Laplace transforms, ordinary
differential equations, systems of linear equations, and
vectors, matrices, and tensors. Maxima produces high precision
results by using exact fractions and arbitrarily long floating
point representations, and can plot functions and data in two
and three dimensions.
Maxima is a descendant of Macsyma, the legendary computer 
algebra system developed in the late 1960s at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

[Name] GooCanvas
[Summary] A cairo-based canvas widget for GTK+
[Description] GooCanvas is similar in many ways to GnomeCanvas and FooCanvas.
But it uses cairo for rendering, has an optional model/view split,
and uses interfaces for items & models (so you can easily turn any
application object into a canvas item or model).

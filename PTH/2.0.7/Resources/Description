[Name] PTH
[Summary] The GNU Portable Threads
[Description] Pth is a very portable POSIX/ANSI-C based library for
Unix platforms which provides non-preemptive priority-based scheduling
for multiple threads of execution ("multithreading") inside server
applications. All threads run in the same address space of the server
application, but each thread has its own individual program-counter,
run-time stack, signal mask and errno variable.

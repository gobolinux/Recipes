[Description] Emotion is an Evas smart-object library providing video 
capabilities. Emotion leverages libxine 1.0 and integrates seamlessly 
with the rest of the EFL. Because its based on libxine, any format that 
it supports (Theora, DiVX, MPEG2, etc) is available using Emotion.
With Emotion it's unbelievably easy to add video to your application, 
and by leveraging the rest of the EFL to build more powerful video 
players than seen anywhere else.

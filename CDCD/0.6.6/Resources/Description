[Description] cdcd is a command-driven cd player; it uses the facilities provided by libcdaudio and can be called just once to do one particular action (for example, $ cdcd play Lazarus 2:14 will play a song containing "lazarus" in its name, starting at position 2 minutes 14 seconds), or as a command interpreter (i.e. you will have a cdcd> prompt).

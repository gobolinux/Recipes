[Description] bbkeys is the keygrabber for the Blackbox window manager. bbkeys handles all
keybindings and keyboard shortcuts for Blackbox. It uses Blackbox's Image
classes for rendering its look and feel, so bbkeys will draw itself to match
whatever Blackbox style is used. It is highly configurable via the bbconf GUI
utility, the included bbkeysconf.pl perl script, or via hand-editing bbkeys's
config file.

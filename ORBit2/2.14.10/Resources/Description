[Description] ORBit2 is a major revision to the ORBit code base, \
adding the foundations of threading support, a massively shrunk and \
genericised code base, and lots more power, completeness, and \
correctness. \
ORBit is a high-performance CORBA (Common Object Request Broker \
Architecture) ORB (Object Request Broker). It allows programs to send \
requests and receive replies from other programs, regardless of the \
locations of the two programs. CORBA is an architecture that enables \
communication between program objects, regardless of the programming \
language they are written in or the operating system they run on. You \
will need to install this package if you want to run programs that use \
the CORBA technology ORBit implementation.

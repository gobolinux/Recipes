[Description] In Armagetron, you ride a lightcycle around the game grid. You can only make sharp turns of 90 degrees and a wall constantly builds up after you. Make your enemies crash into your wall, but be aware that they are trying to do the same to you. If you are fast enough, you may be able to trap them, but the only way to speed up your lightcycle is to drive close to the dangerous walls. Prepare for exciting strategic preparations followed by action-packed close combat!

[Description] 

KEGS emulates an Apple IIgs accurately at between 8MHz and 120MHz on
pretty much any Unix/Linux computer, Win32, or Mac OS X.

As the Apple IIgs is backwards compatible with the Apple II line, KEGS
can also run almost all Apple II software.

You'll need to supply a copy of the Apple IIgs ROM (version 1 or 3).
You should put the ROM file at:

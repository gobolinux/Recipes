[Description]
Xclip is a command line utility that is designed to run 
on any system with an X11 implementation. It provides an interface to 
X selections ("the clipboard") from the command line. It can read data 
from standard in or a file and place it in an X selection for pasting 
into other X applications. xclip can also print an X selection to 
standard out, which can then be redirected to a file or another 
program.

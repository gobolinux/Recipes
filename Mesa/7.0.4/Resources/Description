[Name] Mesa
[Summary] 3-D graphics library which uses the OpenGL API
[License] OSI Approved
[Description] Mesa is a 3-D graphics library which uses the OpenGL API (Application Programming Interface). Mesa cannot be called an implementation of OpenGL since the author did not obtain an OpenGL license from SGI. Furthermore, Mesa cannot claim OpenGL conformance since the conformance tests are only available to OpenGL licensees. Despite these technical/legal terms, you may find Mesa to be a valid alternative to OpenGL. Most applications written for OpenGL can use Mesa instead without changing the source code.

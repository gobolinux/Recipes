[Name] UFRaw
[Summary] A utility to read and manipulate raw images from digital cameras.
[Description] The Unidentified Flying Raw (UFRaw) is a utility to read and 
manipulate raw images from digital cameras. It can be used on its own or as 
a Gimp plug-in. It reads raw images using Dave Coffin's raw conversion 
utility - DCRaw. UFRaw supports color management workflow based on Little 
CMS, allowing the user to apply ICC color profiles. For Nikon users UFRaw 
has the advantage that it can read the camera's tone curves. Even if you don't 
own a Nikon, you can still apply a Nikon curve to your images.

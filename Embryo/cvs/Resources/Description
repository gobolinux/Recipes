[Description] Embryo implements a C like scripting language used in 
various parts of the Enlightenment project, namely Edje. Embryo's 
scripting language is based on CompuPhase's Small language that was 
introduced in Dr Dobb's Journal in 1999. Embryo allows scripting 
capabilities in places that otherwise wouldn't support basic programming 
structures such as in Edje EDCs.

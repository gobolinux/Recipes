[Name] MLDonkey
[Summary] MLDonkey - the Open Source eDonkey client
[Description] MLDonkey was originally intended as a pure eDonkey2000 clone, running on Unix and Linux, a sector that the original client never served well. Since the release of version 2, there has also been development to access other networks, most notably the eDonkey2000 offspring Overnet, BitTorrent, Kademlia and DirectConnect.

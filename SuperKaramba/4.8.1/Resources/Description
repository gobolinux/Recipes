[Description] SuperKaramba is a tool that allows anyone to
easily create and run little interactive widgets
on a KDE desktop. Widgets are defined in a simple
text file and can be augmented with Python code to
make them interactive. Current widgets include
everything from simple news headline displays to
complete custom replacements for kicker, the KDE
toolbar.

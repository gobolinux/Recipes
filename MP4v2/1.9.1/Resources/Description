[Name] MP4v2
[Summary] A library that provides an API to create and modify mp4 files.
[Description] The MP4v2 library provides an API to create and modify mp4
files as defined by ISO-IEC:14496-1:2001 MPEG-4 Systems. This file
format is derived from Apple's QuickTime file format that has been used
as a multimedia file format in a variety of platforms and applications.
It is a very powerful and extensible format that can accomodate
practically any type of media.
MP4v2 was originally bundled with mpeg4ip library, but has been moved
into its own maintained library due to a combination of the cessation of
support of mpeg4ip and the usefulness of this library on its own.

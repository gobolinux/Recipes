[Summary] Guifications is a Pidgin plugin that displays "toaster" popups
[Description] Guifications is a Pidgin plugin that displays "toaster" popups in a user-defined corner of the screen, similar to features that have been added to the official MSN Messenger (now called Windows Live Messenger), Yahoo! Messenger and AOL Instant Messenger clients. It's highly configurable, easy to use, and has theme support. It really is the end-all, be-all toaster pop-up plugin for Pidgin!

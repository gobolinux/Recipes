[Name] MD5Deep
[Summary] md5deep is a cross-platform set of programs to compute MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, Tiger, or Whirlpool message 
digests on an arbitrary number of files.
[Description] md5deep is similar to the md5sum program found in the GNU Coreutils package, but has the following 
additional features:

    * Recursive operation - md5deep is able to recursively examine an entire directory tree. That is, compute the MD5 
for every file in a directory and for every file in every subdirectory.
    * Comparison mode - md5deep can accept a list of known hashes and compare them to a set of input files. The 
program can display either those input files that match the list of known hashes or those that do not match. Hashes 
sets can be drawn from Encase, the National Software Reference Library, iLook Investigator, Hashkeeper, md5sum, BSD 
md5, and other generic hash generating programs. Users are welcome to add functionality to read other formats too!
    * Time estimation - md5deep can produce a time estimate when it's processing very large files.
    * Piecewise hashing - Hash input files in arbitrary sized blocks
    * File type mode - md5deep can process only files of a certain type, such as regular files, block devices, etc.

# Adding the --enable-gtk option activates some GTK-related tests according to
# 'configure --help', and requires Pixman to have already been compiled and
# installed in order to rebuild it.  In other words, this causes configure to
# fail if Pixman is being built for the first time when GTK 2 is installed.
# The configure script seems to automatically determine the proper course of
# action on its own just fine, so it's probably best not to enable the following
# line.

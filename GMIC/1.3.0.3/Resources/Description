[Summary] G'MIC is an interpreter of image processing macros
[Description] G'MIC is an interpreter of image processing macros whose goal 
is to convert, manipulate  and visualize generic 1D/2D/3D multi-spectral 
image files. This includes classical color images, but also more complex data 
as image sequences or 3D volumetric datasets. G'MIC defines a simple 
macro-based language which allows the user to extend the number of available 
commands recognized and to define its own image filters and effects.

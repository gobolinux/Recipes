[Summary]  The Tcl scripting language
[Description]  Tcl, the "Tool Command Language", is a very simple programming language. Tcl provides basic language features such as variables, procedures, and control. It runs on almost any modern OS, such as Unix, Macintosh, and Windows 95/98/NT computers. The key feature of Tcl is its extensibility. Tcl was originally developed as a reusable command language for experimental Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools. The interpreter was implemented as a C library which could be linked to any application. It is very easy to add new functionality to the Tcl interpreter, so it is an ideal, reusable "macro language" that can be integrated into many applications. One of Tcl's best loved features is the ease with which one can add new commands (known as extensions). New commands can range from something as simple as a new format for producing output, to extensions such as Tk which provide graphically oriented programming paradigms. Another very popular extension is Expect which can be used to automate console-based interactive applications. For more information on Tcl see http://www.tcl.tk and http://wiki.tcl.tk .

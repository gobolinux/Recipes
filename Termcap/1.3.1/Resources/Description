[Name] 
Termcap

[Summary]
Termcap is a library and data base that enables programs to use display terminals in a terminal-independent manner.

[Description]
The termcap data base describes the capabilities of hundreds of different 
display terminals in great detail. Some examples of the information recorded
for a terminal could include how many columns wide it is, what string to 
send to move the cursor to an arbitrary position (including how to encode 
the row and column numbers), how to scroll the screen up one or several lines,
and how much padding is needed for such a scrolling operation.

The termcap library is provided for easy access this data base in programs 
that want to do terminal-independent character-based display output.

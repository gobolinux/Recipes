feh is a fast, lightweight image viewer which uses imlib2. It is commandline-driven and supports multiple 
images through slideshows, thumbnail browsing or multiple windows, and montages or index prints (using 
truetype fonts to display file info). Advanced features include fast dynamic zooming, progressive loading, 
loading via HTTP (with reload support for watching webcams), recursive file opening (slideshow of a directory 
hierarchy), and mousewheel/keyboard control.

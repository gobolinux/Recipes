[Name] Python-Audio-Tools
[Summary] A collection of audio handling python scripts (command line).
[Description] Python Audio Tools are a collection of audio handling
programs which work from the command line. These include programs for CD
extraction, track conversion from one audio format to another, track
renaming and retagging, track identification, CD burning from tracks,
and more. Supports internationalized track filenames and metadata using
Unicode. Works with high-definition, multi-channel audio as well as
CD-quality. Track conversion uses multiple CPUs or CPU cores if
available to greatly speed the transcoding process. Track metadata can
be retrieved from FreeDB or FreeDB-compatible servers.

[Name] PCRE2
[Summary] Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions
[Description] The PCRE2 library is a set of C functions that implement regular expression pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl 5. PCRE2 has its own native API, as well as a set of wrapper functions that correspond to the POSIX regular expression API. The PCRE2 library is free, even for building proprietary software. It comes in three forms, for processing 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit code units, in either literal or UTF encoding.

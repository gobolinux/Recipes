[Name] CheckGmail
[Summary] Alternative Gmail Notifier for Linux and other *nix systems
[Description] CheckGmail is a system tray application that checks a Gmail
account for new mail. When new mail is present the tray icon changes, an
optional animated popup is displayed and a tooltip displays the number and
details of new messages. Each message can be opened directly in a browser
window, and many common Gmail operations (marking as read, archiving, deleting
or reporting as spam) can be carried out on messages directly within CheckGmail,
without the need to use the Gmail web interface.

TiMidity++ is a software synthesizer. It can play MIDI files by converting them into PCM waveform data; 
give it a MIDI data along with digital instrument data files, then it synthesizes them in real-time, 
and plays. It can not only play sounds, but also can save the generated waveforms into hard disks 
as various audio file formats.

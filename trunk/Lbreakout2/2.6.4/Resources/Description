[Name] Lbreakout2
[Summary] Another - very nice - Arkanoid clone
[Description] The successor to LBreakout offers you a new challenge in more than 50 levels with loads of new bonuses (goldshower, joker, explosive balls, bonus magnet ...), maluses (chaos, darkness, weak balls, malus magnet ...) and special bricks (growing bricks, explosive bricks, regenerative bricks ...). If you are hungry for more you can create your own levelsets with the integrated level editor. There is also an experimental two player mode (via LAN) available. The Author is pleased to say, that this game won the No Starch Press SDL Game Contest.

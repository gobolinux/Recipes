[Name] Rdiff-Backup
[Summary] rdiff-backup backs up one directory to another, possibly over a network.
[Description] rdiff-backup backs up one directory to another, possibly over
a network. The target directory ends up a copy of the source directory, but
extra reverse diffs are stored in a special subdirectory of that target
directory, so you can still recover files lost some time ago. The idea is
to combine the best features of a mirror and an incremental backup.

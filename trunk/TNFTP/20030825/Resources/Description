[Description] tnftp (formerly known as lukemftp) is a port of
the NetBSD FTP client to other systems. It offers
many enhancements over the traditional BSD FTP
client, including command-line editing,
command-line fetches of FTP and HTTP URLs
(including via proxies), command-line uploads of
FTP URLs, context-sensitive word completion,
dynamic progress bar, IPv6 support, modification
time preservation, paging of local and remote
files, passive mode support (with fallback to
active mode), SOCKS support, TIS FWTK gate-ftp
server support, and transfer rate throttling.
tnftp is the default FTP client found in FreeBSD,
MacOS X, NetBSD, and SuSE Linux.

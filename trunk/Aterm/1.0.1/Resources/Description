[Description] aterm (AfterStep term) is an xterm replacement, based on rxvt v.2.4.8. It includes features such as NeXT style scrollbar, resource efficient pseudo-transparency. It understands root background changes by AfterStep Pager and Esetroot. The primary goal of aterm is to provide cool visual features without resource consumption. It can be compiled to utilize AfterStep's libasimage for wider image format support.

[Description] KDE is a powerful graphical desktop environment
for Unix workstations. It combines ease of use,
contemporary functionality and outstanding
graphical design with the technological
superiority of the Unix operating system. KDE is a
completely new desktop, incorporating a large
suite of applications for Unix workstations. While
KDE includes a window manager, file manager,
panel, control center and many other components
that one would expect to be part of a contemporary
desktop environment, the true strength of this
exceptional environment lies in the
interoperability of its components.

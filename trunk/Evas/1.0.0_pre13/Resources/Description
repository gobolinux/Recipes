[Description] Evas is a canvas library, designed to work with the X Window System. It is designed to be able to take advantage of any graphics hardware or CPU processing power you may have, or to adjust for the lack of it. It has a simplistic API to access the features of a canvas to aid in making development using Evas easy.

[Name] UWM
[Summary] UWM (Ultimate Window Manager) is the Windowmanger of the UDE-Project
[Description] The UDE-Project (Unix Desktop Environment) is creating a new Windowmanager which will be a complete GUI in future. The project does not use any special GUI-Libraries such as QT or GTK+. It just uses the standard Xlibs. UDE has a completely original Look'n'Feel, it's not just another copy of the so well known "classical" window management user interface.

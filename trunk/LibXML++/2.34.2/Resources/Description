[Name] LibXML++
[Summary] LibXML++ is a C++ wrapper for the libxml library.
[Description] LibXML++ is a C++ wrapper for the libxml XML parser
library. It has SAX and DOM-like APIs, but does not attempt to conform
exactly to the DOM specifications, because they are not aimed at C++. Its
API is much simpler than the underlying libxml C API.

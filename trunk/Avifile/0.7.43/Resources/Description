[License] GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)
[Description] Avifile is a library that allows you to read and write compressed AVI files in most common video & audio formats (Indeo® Video, DivX, etc.) under x86 Linux. Compression and decompression are performed with Win32 DLLs. It includes a simple AVI player and a Video4Linux capture program. Currently it is under heavy development, and while some features (such as AVI playback) already work, some (audio compression) are not yet successfully implemented.

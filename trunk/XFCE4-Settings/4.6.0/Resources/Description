[Name] XFCE4-Settings
[Summary] Settings manager for Xfce4 
[Description] The settings manager provides the MCS (Multi-Channel
Settings), a modular, host independent, network transparent and
centralized configuration system. It runs in the background and
provides global settings information to other Xfce components. There
is a main control panel to access the configuration dialogs of all the
components. The MCS plugins provide settings dialogs for general items
that are not part of a package, e.g. GTK, mouse, fonts, keyboard, and
display settings.

[Name] KAnagram
[Summary] Kanagram mixes up the letters of a word (creating an anagram), and you have to guess what the mixed up word is.
[Description] Kanagram is a replacement for KMessedWords, and is new in KDE 3.5. Kanagram mixes up the letters of a word (creating an anagram), and you have to guess what the mixed up word is. Kanagram features several built-in word lists, hints, and a cheat feature which reveals the original word. Kanagram also has a vocabulary editor, so you can make your own vocabularies, and distribute them through Kanagram's KNewStuff download service.

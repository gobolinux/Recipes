[Description] DOSBox uses SDL to emulate the PC hardware 
required for running old DOS games. This 
includes a 386 processor, an S3/Trio video card 
with some tweaks to allow for older display 
hardware like the Tandy, a Sound Blaster Pro, 
the PC speaker, Tandy 3-sound, CMS/GameBlaster, 
Disney Sound Source, and MIDI. DOS emulation is 
integrated. It is possible to mount local 
directories as drives inside the emulator.

[Name] Haskell-Haskeline
[Summary] A command-line interface for user input, written in Haskell.
[Description] Haskeline provides a user interface for line input in command-line programs. This library is similar in purpose to readline, but since it is written in Haskell it is (hopefully) more easily used in other Haskell programs. 

Haskeline runs both on POSIX-compatible systems and on Windows.

[Description] FreeType 2 is a high-quality and portable font engine that is capable of supporting several font formats (be they bitmapped or scalable) through a simple and uniform interface. Its design is modular and allows independent "font driver" modules to be added, even at runtime, to support additional formats. It also provides a high-quality anti-aliasing renderer, an innovative auto-hinting engine, and support for the following font formats: TrueType Type1, CID-Type 1, Multiple Masters Type 1 OpenType/CFF, pure CFF, and CEF Windows FNT/FON.

[Description] xCHM is a cross-platform graphical CHM viewer. \
It's based on CHMLIB and written with wxGTK. It is able \
to display the topics tree, work with displayed \
pages history, print the current page, work with \
bookmarks, change fonts and fast search through \
all the pages of the loaded .chm document. Being \
indirectly dependent on GTK+, the possibility of \
changing GTK+ skins makes xCHM theme-friendly.

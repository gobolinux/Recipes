# There is one little thing to check in this Recipe before considering
# it a very good one: In 'Resources/Environment' file I set the
# 'ESDL_PATH' varible. I'm not sure, but I think this is only used to
# compile Wings3D. Anyway, I can't imagine any other project using
# ESDL apart of Wings3D...
compile_version=1.8.0

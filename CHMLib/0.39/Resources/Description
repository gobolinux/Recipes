[Name] MS CHM library
[Summary] A library for reading Microsoft .CHM files.
[License] GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)
[Description] Microsoft help files and technical documentation \
have been distributed in "compressed HTML" format \
for several years now. The documentation itself \
is, obviously, in HTML, and so would be useful on \
other platforms than Windows. chmlib makes it \
possible to write software that accesses the Web \
content stored in the file, either to extract or \
merely to view.

[Name] NetworkManager 
[Summary] A network manager powered by DBus and HAL 
[Description] NetworkManager attempts to keep an active network connection available at all
times.  The point of NetworkManager is to make networking configuration and
setup as painless and automatic as possible.  If using DHCP, NetworkManager is
_intended_ to replace default routes, obtain IP addresses from a DHCP server,
and change nameservers whenever it sees fit.  In effect, the goal of
NetworkManager is to make networking Just Work.  If you have special needs,
we'd like to hear about them, but understand that NetworkManager is not
intended to serve the needs of all users.

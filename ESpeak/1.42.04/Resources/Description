[Name] ESpeak
[Summary] eSpeak is a compact open source software speech synthesizer for English and other languages
[Description] eSpeak is a compact open source software speech synthesizer for English and other languages, for Linux and Windows. eSpeak produces good quality English speech. It uses a different synthesis method from other open source TTS engines, and sounds quite different. It's perhaps not as natural or "smooth", but I find the articulation clearer and easier to listen to for long periods.

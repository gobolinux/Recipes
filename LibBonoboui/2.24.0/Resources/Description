[Name] LibBonoboui
[Description] The Bonobo UI Library provides UI code for Bonobo, the Object
Activation Framework for GNOME 2. Bonobo has a similar purpose to
gnorba, the GNOME 1.x CORBA activation library, and will replace it
for GNOME 2.0. It allows you to do much more powerful activation
queries than gnorba. Each server is described by an XML file that
defines its attributes. When querying or activating, you can specify
complex requirements using the OAF query language.

[Description] KildClient is a MUD Client written 
with the GTK+ windowing toolkit. It supports many 
common features of other clients, such as triggers, 
gags, aliases, macros, timers, and much more. 
But its main feature is the built-in Perl 
interpreter. You can at any moment execute Perl 
statements and functions to do things much more 
powerful than simply sending text the the mud.

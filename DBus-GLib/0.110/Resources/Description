[Name] DBus-GLib
[Summary] DBus bindings for GLib
[Description] D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for \
applications to talk to one another. \
D-Bus supplies both a system daemon (for events such as "new hardware \
device added" or "printer queue changed") and a per-user-login-session \
daemon (for general IPC needs among user applications). \
This is the DBus bindings for GLib for applications using GLib interface \
to DBus.

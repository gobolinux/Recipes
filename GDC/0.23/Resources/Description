[Description] GDC is a D language front end for the GNU Compiler
Collection. It supports a number of targets and nearly all features of
Digital Mars D (see: http://digitalmars.com/d/ ).

D is a systems programming language. Its focus is on combining the
power and high performance of C and C++ with the programmer
productivity of modern languages like Ruby and Python. Special
attention is given to the needs of quality assurance, documentation,
management, portability and reliability.

D is statically typed, and compiles direct to native code. It's
multiparadigm: supporting imperative, object oriented, and template
metaprogramming styles. It's a member of the C syntax family, and its
look and feel is very close to C++'s. For a quick feature comparison,
see http://digitalmars.com/d/comparison.html .

D is not governed by a corporate agenda or any overarching theory of
programming. The needs and contributions of the D programming
community determine future development.

[Name] LibSpiro
[Summary] Library for drawing curves (based on clothoid splines)
[Description] Using bézier splines an artist can easily draw curves
with the same slope on either side of an on-curve point. Spiros, on
the other hand, are based on clothoid splines which make it easy to
maintain constant curvature as well as constant slope.
This library will take an array of spiro control points and convert
them into a series of bézier splines which can then be used in the
myriad of ways the world has come to use béziers.

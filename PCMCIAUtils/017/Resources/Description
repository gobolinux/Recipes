[Name] PCMCIAutils
[Summary] PCMCIA initialization tools
[License] GNU General Public License (GPL)
[Description] PCMCIAutils contains the initialization tools necessary to allow \
the PCMCIA subsystem to behave (almost) as every other hotpluggable bus system \
(e.g. USB, IEEE1394). This is made possible either by hotplug scripts or udev rules. \

Please note that the kernel support for this new feature is only present since 2.6.13-rc1. \
Also, you need sysfsutils 1.3.0 as well as module-init-tools 3.2-pre4 or later, \
and either hotplug or udev installed on your system.

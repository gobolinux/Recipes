[Name] Haskell-Roman-Numerals
[Summary] Parsing and pretty printing of Roman numerals
[Description] This library provides functions for parsing and pretty printing Roman numerals. Because the notation of Roman numerals has varied through the centuries, this package allows for some customization using a configuration that is passed to the conversion functions. Exceptions are dealt with by wrapping the results of conversions in the error monad.

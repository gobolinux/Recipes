[Summary] LibOFX is a parser and an API designed to allow applications to very easily support OFX command responses
[Description] This is the LibOFX library. It is a parser and an API designed to allow applications to very easily support OFX command responses, usually provided by financial institutions for statement downloads. To my knowledge, 
it is the first working OpenSource implementation of the OFX (Open Financial eXchange) specification on the client side. This project was first started as my end of degree project, with the objective to add OFX support to GnuCash. 
It since evolved into a generic library, so all OpenSource Financial software can benefit.

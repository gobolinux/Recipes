Psyco

[Summary] 
Python extension which can speed up execution of Python code.

[Description] 
Think of Psyco as a kind of just-in-time (JIT) compiler, a little 
bit like what exists for other languages, that emit machine code on 
the fly instead of interpreting your Python program step by step. 
The difference with the traditional approach to JIT compilers is 
that Psyco writes several version of the same blocks (a block is a 
bit of a function), which are optimized by being specialized to 
some kinds of variables (a "kind" can mean a type, but it is more 
general). The result is that your unmodified Python programs run 
faster.

Benefits; 2x to 100x speed-ups, typically 4x, with an unmodified 
Python interpreter and unmodified source code, just a dynamically 
loadable C extension module.

Drawbacks; Psyco currently uses a lot of memory. It only runs on 
Intel 386-compatible processors (under any OS) right now. There are 
some subtle semantic differences (i.e. bugs) with the way Python 
works; they should not be apparent in most programs.

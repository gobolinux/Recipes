[Name] CDRDAO
[Summary] Disk-At-Once Recording of Audio CD-Rs
[License] GNU General Public License (GPL)
[Description] Cdrdao records audio/data CD-Rs in disk-at-once (DAO) mode based on a textual description of the CD contents (toc-file). Features include full control over length and contents of pre-gaps (pause areas between tracks). Pre-gaps may be completely omitted, e.g. for dividing live recordings into tracks. Control over sub-channel data like catalog numbers, copy, pre-emphasis, 2-/4-channel flags, ISRC code, and index marks are provided as well. Cdrdao also has support for exact audio CD copying. Tracks may be composed of different audio files supporting non-destructive cuts.

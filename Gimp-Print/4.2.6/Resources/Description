[Description] Gimp-Print is a collection of very high quality printer drivers for UNIX/Linux. The goal of this project is uncompromising print quality and robustness. Included with this package is the Print plugin for the GIMP (hence the name), a CUPS driver, and two drivers (traditional and IJS-based) for Ghostscript that may be compiled into that package. This driver package is Foomatic-compatible and provides Foomatic data to enable plug and play with many print spoolers. In addition, various printer maintenance utilities are included. Many users report that the quality of Gimp-Print on high end Epson Stylus printers matches or exceeds the quality of the drivers supplied for Windows and Macintosh.

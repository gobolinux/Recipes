[Name] RFKill
[Summary] Tool for handling radio switches
[Description] rfkill is a small userspace tool to query the state of the
rfkill switches, buttons and subsystem interfaces. Some devices come with a
hard switch that lets you kill different types of RF radios: 802.11 /
Bluetooth / NFC / UWB / WAN / WIMAX / FM. Some times these buttons may kill
more than one RF type. The Linux kernel rfkill subsystem exposes these
hardware buttons and lets userspace query its status and set its status
through a /dev/rfkill. Given that at times some RF devices do not have
hardware rfkill buttons rfkill the Linux kernel also exposes software rfkill
capabilities that allows userspace to mimic a hardware rfkill event and turn
on or off RF.

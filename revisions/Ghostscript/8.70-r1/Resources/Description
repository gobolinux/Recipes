[License] GNU General Public License (GPL)
[Description] An interpreter for the PostScript language and PDF, \
that can convert PS and PDF files to raster formats, display them and \
print them on printers without PostScript support. \
Ghostscript can also convert PS to PDF (with some limitations) and PDF \
to PS. It also provides a library with PS and PDF functions for \
inclusion in other applications.
This package is originally Artofcode-Ghostscript with the addition of
functions from ESP-Ghostscript and therefor obsoletes those packages.

[License] MIT/X Consortium License
[Description] Lua is a programming language originally designed for extending applications, but also frequently used as a general-purpose, stand-alone language. It combines simple procedural syntax (similar to Pascal) with powerful data description constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. It is dynamically typed, interpreted from bytecodes, and has automatic memory management, making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping. It is implemented as a small library of C functions, written in ANSI C, and compiles unmodified in all known platforms. The implementation goals are simplicity, efficiency, portability, and low embedding cost. It has been used on games such as Battle Mages, Vendetta, FarCry, Homeworld2, and Painkiller.

[Summary] Top-like process viewer for Linux
[Description] htop is an interactive process viewer for Linux.
It aims to be a 'better top': you can scroll the
process list vertically and horizontally, and
select a process to be killed with the arrow keys
instead of by typing its process id. It requires
ncurses, and was tested with Linux 2.4 and 2.6.

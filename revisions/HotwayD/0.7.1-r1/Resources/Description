[Description] Hotwayd is a POP3/SMTP to HTTPMail (WebDAV) gateway. HTTPMail is a somewhat undocumented WebDAV-based protocol used by a variety of mail servers including Hotmail, MSN, Lycos, and Spray. Hotwayd allows you to use any standard POP3/SMTP mail reader to send and receive mail via these servers, similar to the way that Outlook Express can access a hotmail account. It supports features such as folder selection to get folders other than the inbox and proxy server support (if you require a proxy to access the internet).

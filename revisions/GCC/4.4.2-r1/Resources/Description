[Summary] The GNU Compiler Collection
[License] GNU General Public License (GPL)
[Description] The GNU Compiler Collection contains frontends for
C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Java, and Ada as
well as libraries for these languages. It is a
full-featured ANSI C compiler with support for K&R
C as well. GCC provides many levels of source code
error checking traditionally provided by other
tools (such as lint), produces debugging
information, and can perform many different
optimizations to the resulting object code.

[Description] DR17 of the Enlightenment window manager represents an evolution into the next 
generation of desktop environments: the desktop shell. DR17 will provide integration between 
files and your environment in a seamless manner while encompassing a graphically rich and 
flexible architecture. It will not compete with GNOME or KDE, but be a completely new way of 
visualizing your desktop, based around the EFL which was built from the ground up for this task.

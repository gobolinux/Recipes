[Description] Libgcrypt is a general-purpose cryptographic
library based on the code from GnuPG. It provides
functions for all cryptographic building blocks:
symmetric ciphers (AES, DES, Blowfish, CAST5,
Twofish, and Arcfour), hash algorithms (MD4, MD5,
RIPE-MD160, SHA-1, and TIGER-192), MACs (HMAC for
all hash algorithms), public key algorithms (RSA,
ElGamal, and DSA), large integer functions, random
numbers, and a lot of supporting functions.

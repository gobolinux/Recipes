[Description] Gri is an extensible plotting program designed for scientists. It can draw x-y plots, contour plots, and image plots, and has rudimentary programming capabilities. Output is PostScript. Gri is not mouse driven, nor GUI-based; it is a language. Users regard it as an analogue to the LaTeX document formatting language: users gain considerable power, at the price of a moderate learning curve.

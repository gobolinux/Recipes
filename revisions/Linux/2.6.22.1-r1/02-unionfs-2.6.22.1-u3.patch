+Unionfs 2.0 CONCEPTS:
+=====================
+
+This file describes the concepts needed by a namespace unification file
+system.
+
+
+Branch Priority:
+================
+
+Each branch is assigned a unique priority - starting from 0 (highest
+priority).  No two branches can have the same priority.
+
+
+Branch Mode:
+============
+
+Each branch is assigned a mode - read-write or read-only. This allows
+directories on media mounted read-write to be used in a read-only manner.
+
+
+Whiteouts:
+==========
+
+A whiteout removes a file name from the namespace. Whiteouts are needed when
+one attempts to remove a file on a read-only branch.
+
+Suppose we have a two-branch union, where branch 0 is read-write and branch
+1 is read-only. And a file 'foo' on branch 1:
+
+./b0/
+./b1/
+./b1/foo
+
+The unified view would simply be:
+
+./union/
+./union/foo
+
+Since 'foo' is stored on a read-only branch, it cannot be removed. A
+whiteout is used to remove the name 'foo' from the unified namespace. Again,
+since branch 1 is read-only, the whiteout cannot be created there. So, we
+try on a higher priority (lower numerically) branch and create the whiteout
+there.
+
+./b0/
+./b0/.wh.foo
+./b1/
+./b1/foo
+
+Later, when Unionfs traverses branches (due to lookup or readdir), it
+eliminate 'foo' from the namespace (as well as the whiteout itself.)
+
+
+Duplicate Elimination:
+======================
+
+It is possible for files on different branches to have the same name.
+Unionfs then has to select which instance of the file to show to the user.
+Given the fact that each branch has a priority associated with it, the
+simplest solution is to take the instance from the highest priority
+(numerically lowest value) and "hide" the others.
+
+
+Copyup:
+=======
+
+When a change is made to the contents of a file's data or meta-data, they
+have to be stored somewhere. The best way is to create a copy of the
+original file on a branch that is writable, and then redirect the write
+though to this copy. The copy must be made on a higher priority branch so
+that lookup and readdir return this newer "version" of the file rather than
+the original (see duplicate elimination).
+
+
+Cache Coherency:
+================
+
+Unionfs users often want to be able to modify files and directories directly
+on the lower branches, and have those changes be visible at the Unionfs
+level.  This means that data (e.g., pages) and meta-data (dentries, inodes,
+open files, etc.) have to be synchronized between the upper and lower
+layers.  In other words, the newest changes from a layer below have to be
+propagated to the Unionfs layer above.  If the two layers are not in sync, a
+cache incoherency ensues, which could lead to application failures and even
+oopses.  The Linux kernel, however, has a rather limited set of mechanisms
+to ensure this inter-layer cache coherency---so Unionfs has to do most of
+the hard work on its own.
+
+Maintaining Invariants:
+
+The way Unionfs ensures cache coherency is as follows.  At each entry point
+to a Unionfs file system method, we call a utility function to validate the
+primary objects of this method.  Generally, we call unionfs_file_revalidate
+on open files, and __Unionfs_d_revalidate_chain on dentries (which also
+validates inodes).  These utility functions check to see whether the upper
+Unionfs object is in sync with any of the lower objects that it represents.
+The checks we perform include whether the Unionfs superblock has a newer
+generation number, or if any of the lower objects mtime's or ctime's are
+newer.  (Note: generation numbers change when branch-management commands are
+issued, so in a way, maintaining cache coherency is also very important for
+branch-management.)  If indeed we determine that any Unionfs object is no
+longer in sync with its lower counterparts, then we rebuild that object
+similarly to how we do so for branch-management.
+
+While rebuilding Unionfs's objects, we also purge any page mappings and
+truncate inode pages (see fs/Unionfs/dentry.c:purge_inode_data).  This is to
+ensure that Unionfs will re-get the newer data from the lower branches.  We
+perform this purging only if the Unionfs operation in question is a reading
+operation; if Unionfs is performing a data writing operation (e.g., ->write,
+->commit_write, etc.) then we do NOT flush the lower mappings/pages: this is
+because (1) a self-deadlock could occur and (2) the upper Unionfs pages are
+considered more authoritative anyway, as they are newer and will overwrite
+any lower pages.
+
+Unionfs maintains the following important invariant regarding mtime's,
+ctime's, and atime's: the upper inode object's times are the max() of all of
+the lower ones.  For non-directory objects, there's only one object below,
+so the mapping is simple; for directory objects, there could me multiple
+lower objects and we have to sync up with the newest one of all the lower
+ones.  This invariant is important to maintain, especially for directories
+(besides, we need this to be POSIX compliant).  A union could comprise
+multiple writable branches, each of which could change.  If we don't reflect
+the newest possible mtime/ctime, some applications could fail.  For example,
+NFSv2/v3 exports check for newer directory mtimes on the server to determine
+if the client-side attribute cache should be purged.
+
+To maintain these important invariants, of course, Unionfs carefully
+synchronizes upper and lower times in various places.  For example, if we
+copy-up a file to a top-level branch, the parent directory where the file
+was copied up to will now have a new mtime: so after a successful copy-up,
+we sync up with the new top-level branch's parent directory mtime.
+
+Implementation:
+
+This cache-coherency implementation is efficient because it defers any
+synchronizing between the upper and lower layers until absolutely needed.
+Consider the example a common situation where users perform a lot of lower
+changes, such as untarring a whole package.  While these take place,
+typically the user doesn't access the files via Unionfs; only after the
+lower changes are done, does the user try to access the lower files.  With
+our cache-coherency implementation, the entirety of the changes to the lower
+branches will not result in a single CPU cycle spent at the Unionfs level
+until the user invokes a system call that goes through Unionfs.
+
+We have considered two alternate cache-coherency designs.  (1) Using the
+dentry/inode notify functionality to register interest in finding out about
+any lower changes.  This is a somewhat limited and also a heavy-handed
+approach which could result in many notifications to the Unionfs layer upon
+each small change at the lower layer (imagine a file being modified multiple
+times in rapid succession).  (2) Rewriting the VFS to support explicit
+callbacks from lower objects to upper objects.  We began exploring such an
+implementation, but found it to be very complicated--it would have resulted
+in massive VFS/MM changes which are unlikely to be accepted by the LKML
+community.  We therefore believe that our current cache-coherency design and
+implementation represent the best approach at this time.
+
+Limitations:
+
+Our implementation works in that as long as a user process will have caused
+Unionfs to be called, directly or indirectly, even to just do
+->d_revalidate; then we will have purged the current Unionfs data and the
+process will see the new data.  For example, a process that continually
+re-reads the same file's data will see the NEW data as soon as the lower
+file had changed, upon the next read(2) syscall (even if the file is still
+open!)  However, this doesn't work when the process re-reads the open file's
+data via mmap(2) (unless the user unmaps/closes the file and remaps/reopens
+it).  Once we respond to ->readpage(s), then the kernel maps the page into
+the process's address space and there doesn't appear to be a way to force
+the kernel to invalidate those pages/mappings, and force the process to
+re-issue ->readpage.  If there's a way to invalidate active mappings and
+force a ->readpage, let us know please (invalidate_inode_pages2 doesn't do
+the trick).
+
+Our current Unionfs code has to perform many file-revalidation calls.  It
+would be really nice if the VFS would export an optional file system hook
+->file_revalidate (similarly to dentry->d_revalidate) that will be called
+before each VFS op that has a "struct file" in it.
+

+KNOWN Unionfs 2.0 ISSUES:
+=========================
+
+1. The NFS server returns -EACCES for read-only exports, instead of -EROFS.
+   This means we can't reliably detect a read-only NFS export.
+
+2. Unionfs should not use lookup_one_len() on the underlying f/s as it
+   confuses NFSv4.  Currently, unionfs_lookup() passes lookup intents to the
+   lower file-system, this eliminates part of the problem.  The remaining
+   calls to lookup_one_len may need to be changed to pass an intent.  We are
+   currently introducing VFS changes to fs/namei.c's do_path_lookup() to
+   allow proper file lookup and opening in stackable file systems.

+Unionfs is a stackable unification file system, which can appear to merge
+the contents of several directories (branches), while keeping their physical
+content separate.  Unionfs is useful for unified source tree management,
+merged contents of split CD-ROM, merged separate software package
+directories, data grids, and more.  Unionfs allows any mix of read-only and
+read-write branches, as well as insertion and deletion of branches anywhere
+in the fan-out.  To maintain Unix semantics, Unionfs handles elimination of
+duplicates, partial-error conditions, and more.
+
+# mount -t unionfs -o branch-option[,union-options[,...]] none MOUNTPOINT
+
+The available branch-option for the mount command is:
+
+	dirs=branch[=ro|=rw][:...]
+
+specifies a separated list of which directories compose the union.
+Directories that come earlier in the list have a higher precedence than
+those which come later. Additionally, read-only or read-write permissions of
+the branch can be specified by appending =ro or =rw (default) to each
+directory.
+
+Syntax:
+
+	dirs=/branch1[=ro|=rw]:/branch2[=ro|=rw]:...:/branchN[=ro|=rw]
+
+Example:
+
+	dirs=/writable_branch=rw:/read-only_branch=ro
+
+
+DYNAMIC BRANCH MANAGEMENT AND REMOUNTS
+======================================
+
+You can remount a union and change its overall mode, or reconfigure the
+branches, as follows.
+
+To downgrade a union from read-write to read-only:
+
+# mount -t unionfs -o remount,ro none MOUNTPOINT
+
+To upgrade a union from read-only to read-write:
+
+# mount -t unionfs -o remount,rw none MOUNTPOINT
+
+To delete a branch /foo, regardless where it is in the current union:
+
+# mount -t unionfs -o remount,del=/foo none MOUNTPOINT
+
+To insert (add) a branch /foo before /bar:
+
+# mount -t unionfs -o remount,add=/bar:/foo none MOUNTPOINT
+
+To insert (add) a branch /foo (with the "rw" mode flag) before /bar:
+
+# mount -t unionfs -o remount,add=/bar:/foo=rw none MOUNTPOINT
+
+To insert (add) a branch /foo (in "rw" mode) at the very beginning (i.e., a
+new highest-priority branch), you can use the above syntax, or use a short
+hand version as follows:
+
+# mount -t unionfs -o remount,add=/foo none MOUNTPOINT
+
+To append a branch to the very end (new lowest-priority branch):
+
+# mount -t unionfs -o remount,add=:/foo none MOUNTPOINT
+
+To append a branch to the very end (new lowest-priority branch), in
+read-only mode:
+
+# mount -t unionfs -o remount,add=:/foo:ro none MOUNTPOINT
+
+Finally, to change the mode of one existing branch, say /foo, from read-only
+to read-write, and change /bar from read-write to read-only:
+
+# mount -t unionfs -o remount,mode=/foo=rw,mode=/bar=ro none MOUNTPOINT
+
+
+CACHE CONSISTENCY
+=================
+
+If you modify any file on any of the lower branches directly, while there is
+a Unionfs 2.0 mounted above any of those branches, you should tell Unionfs
+to purge its caches and re-get the objects.  To do that, you have to
+increment the generation number of the superblock using the following
+command:
+
+# mount -t unionfs -o remount,incgen none MOUNTPOINT
+
+Note that the older way of incrementing the generation number using an
+ioctl, is no longer supported in Unionfs 2.0.  Ioctls in general are not
+encouraged.  Plus, an ioctl is per-file concept, whereas the generation
+number is a per-file-system concept.  Worse, such an ioctl requires an open
+file, which then has to be invalidated by the very nature of the generation
+number increase (read: the old generation increase ioctl was pretty racy).

+ * Unionfs doesn't implement ->writepages, which is OK with the VFS and
+ * keeps our code simpler and smaller.  Nevertheless, somehow, our own
+ * ->writepage must be called so we can sync the upper pages with the lower
+ * pages: otherwise data changed at the upper layer won't get written to the
+ * lower layer.
+ *
+ * Some lower file systems (e.g., NFS) expect the VFS to call its writepages
+ * only, which in turn will call generic_writepages and invoke each of the
+ * lower file system's ->writepage.  NFS in particular uses the
+ * wbc->fs_private field in its nfs_writepage, which is set in its
+ * nfs_writepages.  So if we don't call the lower nfs_writepages first, then
+ * NFS's nfs_writepage will dereference a NULL wbc->fs_private and cause an
+ * OOPS.  If, however, we implement a unionfs_writepages and then we do call
+ * the lower nfs_writepages, then we "lose control" over the pages we're
+ * trying to write to the lower file system: we won't be writing our own
+ * new/modified data from the upper pages to the lower pages, and any
+ * mmap-based changes are lost.
+ *
+ * This is a fundamental cache-coherency problem in Linux.  The kernel isn't
+ * able to support such stacking abstractions cleanly.  One possible clean
+ * way would be that a lower file system's ->writepage method have some sort
+ * of a callback to validate if any upper pages for the same file+offset
+ * exist and have newer content in them.
+ *
+ * This whole NULL ptr dereference is triggered at the lower file system
+ * (NFS) because the wbc->for_writepages is set to 1.  Therefore, to avoid
+ * this NULL pointer dereference, we set this flag to 0 and restore it upon
+ * exit.  This probably means that we're slightly less efficient in writing
+ * pages out, doing them one at a time, but at least we avoid the oops until
+ * such day as Linux can better support address_space_ops in a stackable
+ * fashion.

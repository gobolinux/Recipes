[Description] cdw is a front-end for some command-line tools used for 
burning data CD and DVD discs and for related tasks. The tools are: 
cdrecord/wodim, mkisofs/genisoimage, growisofs, dvd+rw-mediainfo, 
dvd+rw-format. You can also use cdw to rip tracks from your audio 
CD to raw audio files. Limited support for copying content of CD 
discs to image files is also provided.
cdw uses ncurses library to build user-friendly interface and 
it can be used in UNIX terminal window and in terminal emulator 
(like konsole, rxvt or gnome-console) in X environment.
cdw is developed and tested on my Debian 'lenny' GNU/Linux x64 machine.

[License] BSD License (original)
[Description] Blackbox is yet another addition to the list of window managers for X. It is
written in C++, sharing no common code with any other window manager (even
though the graphics implementation is similar to that of WindowMaker). It
features small code size, a fast interface with simple menus, multiple
workspaces, decorated windows, built-in graphics code to render solids,
gradients, and bevels on the fly, and more.

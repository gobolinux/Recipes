[Description] The Compact Disc Input and Control library encapsulates CD-ROM reading
and control. Applications wishing to be oblivious of the OS- and
device-dependent properties of a CD-ROM can use this library. Some
support for disk image types like BIN/CUE, cdrdao, and NRG is available.
Therefore, applications that use this library also have the ability to
read disc images as though they were CDs. A library for working with
ISO-9660 filesystems is included, as are utility programs for displaying
CD and CD-ROM drive information, reading the blocks of a CD, and
extracting files from an ISO-9660 filesytem image.

[Name] Barrage
[Summary] Shoot'em up action game
[Description] Barrage is a rather violent action game with the objective to kill and destroy as many targets as possible within 3 minutes. You control a gun that may either fire small or large grenades at soldiers, jeeps and tanks. Targets are fast paced and require careful aiming as it takes half a second to reload the gun. Additionally you have to keep an eye on your ammo and reload in time. Useful to kill some minutes of idle time. :)

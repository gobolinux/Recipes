[Summary] Geospatial awareness in applications.
[Description] GeoClue is a software framework which can be used to
enable geospatial awareness in applications. GeoClue utilizes the D-Bus
inter-process communication mechanism to provide location information.
Through this it aims to simplify development of location aware
applications and promote code reuse within the free software and open
source communities by defining a logical boundary between the
applications and underlying location providers. GeoClue is licensed
under the GNU Lesser General Public License and is currently available

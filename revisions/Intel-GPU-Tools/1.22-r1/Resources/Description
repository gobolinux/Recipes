[Name] Intel-GPU-Tools
[Summary] Variety of small tools for testing intel graphics.
[Description] This is a collection of tools for development and testing of the Intel DRM
driver. There are many macro-level test suites that get used against our
driver, including xtest, rendercheck, piglit, and oglconform, but failures
from those can be difficult to track down to kernel changes, and many require
complicated build procedures or specific testing environments to get useful
results.

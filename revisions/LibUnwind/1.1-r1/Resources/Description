[Summary] A portable and efficient C programming interface 
(API) to determine the call-chain of a program.
[Description] The primary goal of this project is to define a 
portable and efficient C programming interface (API) to 
determine the call-chain of a program. The API additionally 
provides the means to manipulate the preserved (callee-saved) 
state of each call-frame and to resume execution at any point 
in the call-chain (non-local goto). The API supports both local 
(same-process) and remote (across-process) operation. As such, 
the API is useful in a number of applications.

[Name] Tree
[Summary] tree - list contents of directories in a tree-like format. 
[Description] Tree is a recursive directory listing program that
produces a depth indented listing of files. Color is supported ala
dircolors if the LS_COLORS environment variable is set, output is to a
tty, and the -C flag is used. With no arguments, tree lists the files
in the current directory. When directory arguments are given, tree
lists all the files and/or directories found in the given directories
each in turn. Upon completion of listing all files/directories found,
tree returns the total number of files and/or directories listed.

By default, when a symbolic link is encountered, the path that the
symbolic link refers to is printed after the name of the link in the
format:

name -> real-path

If the '-l' option is given and the symbolic link refers to an actual
directory, then tree will follow the path of the symbolic link as if
it were a real directory.

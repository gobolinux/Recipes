[Description] Epoxy is a library for handling OpenGL function pointer management for you.
It hides the complexity of dlopen(), dlsym(), glXGetProcAddress(),
eglGetProcAddress(), etc. from the app developer, with very little knowledge
needed on their part. They get to read GL specs and write code using
undecorated function names like glCompileShader().

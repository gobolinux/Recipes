[Description] KSmoothDock is a desktop panel, similar to KDE's
kicker, for KDE 3.2. Its most distinctive feature
is smooth icon zooming in one of two modes: normal
and parabolic. Its aim is to provide a cool
alternative and complement to kicker. As it is
intended for KDE and Linux, its behavior resembles
that of kicker.

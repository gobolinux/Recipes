[Name] GNU Aspell
[Summary] Intelligent Spell Checker
[License] GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)
[Description] GNU Aspell is a spell checker designed to eventually replace ispell. It can either be used as a library or as an independent spell checker. Its main feature is that it does a much better job of coming up with possible suggestions than just about any other spell checker out there for the English language. It also uses shared memory for dictionaries and intelligently handles personal dictionaries when more than one Aspell process is open at once.

[Summary] GNU Image Finding Tool - index and search images by content
[Description] The GIFT (the GNU Image-Finding Tool) is a Content Based
Image Retrieval System (CBIRS). It enables you to do Query By Example
on images, giving you the opportunity to improve query results by
relevance feedback. For processing your queries the program relies
entirely on the content of the images, freeing you from the need to
annotate all images before querying the collection. 
The GIFT comes with a tool which lets you index whole directory trees
containing images in one go. You then can use the GIFT server and its
client, to browse your own image collections. 
The GIFT is an open framework. The developers explicitly have taken
into account the possibility of adding new ways of querying to the
framework. The communication protocol for client-server communication,
MRML, is XML based and fully documented (http://www.mrml.net). This
aims at promoting code reuse among researchers and application
developers.

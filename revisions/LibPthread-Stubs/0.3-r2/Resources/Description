[Name] LibPthread-Stubs
[Summary] Pthread functions stubs for platforms missing them
[Description] libpthread-stubs provides stub functions for pthreads as weak aliases for platforms on which libc does not provide these stubs. Linking to both libc and libpthread-stubs will always provide a full set of pthread stubs, allowing programs and libraries to portably use pthreads when linked to pthreads and improve single-threaded performance when not linked to pthreads.

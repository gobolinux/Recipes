[Name] ROX-Term
[Summary] A terminal emulator intended to provide similar features to gnome-terminal, but with a smaller footprint and quicker start-up time.
[Description] ROXTerm is a terminal emulator intended to provide similar features to gnome-terminal, based on the same VTE library, but with a smaller footprint and quicker start-up time. It achieves this by not using the Gnome libraries and by using a separate applet to provide the configuration GUI. It can be used as a ROX application, as the name implies, or in any other X environment.

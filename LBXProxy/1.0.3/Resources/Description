[Name] LBXProxy
[Summary] Low BandWidth X proxy
[Description] Applications that would like to take advantage of the Low Bandwidth extension to X (LBX) must make their connections to an lbxproxy. These applications need to know nothing about LBX, they simply connect to the lbxproxy as if were a regular server. The lbxproxy accepts client connections, multiplexes them over a single connection to the X server, and performs various optimizations on the X protocol to make it faster over low bandwidth and/or high latency connections.

With regard to authentication/authorization, lbxproxy simply passes along to the server the credentials presented by the client. Since X clients will connect to lbxproxy, it is important that the user's .Xauthority file contain entries with valid keys associated with the network ID of the proxy. lbxproxy does not get involved with how these entries are added to the .Xauthority file. The user is responsible for setting it up.

[Name] Haskell-Binary
[Summary] Binary serialisation for Haskell values using lazy ByteStrings
[Description] Efficient, pure binary serialisation using lazy ByteStrings. Haskell values may be encoded to and from binary formats, written to disk as binary, or sent over the network. Serialisation speeds of over 1 G/sec have been observed, so this library should be suitable for high performance scenarios.

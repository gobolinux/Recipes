[Description] Libquicktime is based on the great quicktime4linux library with several enhancements. All 3rd-party libraries were removed from the sourcetree. Instead, the systemwide installed libraries are detected by the configure script. All original codecs were moved into dynamically loadable modules, and new codecs are in development. Libquicktime is source-compatible with quicktime4linux (i.e., all quicktime4linux apps can be linked with libquicktime). Special API extensions allow access to the codec registry and more convenient processing of Audio and Video data.  Libquicktime comes with all original utility programs, and additional tools, like a commandline player and a GTK configuration utility which can configure the parameters of all installed codecs. The configuration is stored in the home directory and is be used by all libquicktime applications.

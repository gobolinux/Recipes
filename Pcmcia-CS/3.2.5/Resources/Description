[Description] Card Services for Linux is a complete PCMCIA or PC Card support package. It includes a set of loadable kernel modules that implement a version of the Card Services applications program interface, a set of client drivers for specific cards, and a card manager daemon that can respond to card insertion and removal events, loading and unloading drivers on demand. It supports hot swapping of most card types, so cards can be safely inserted and ejected at any time.

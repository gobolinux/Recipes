[Name] Lua
[Summary] An extensible extension language
[License] MIT/X Consortium License
[Description] Lua is a programming language originally designed for extending
applications, but also frequently used as a general-purpose, stand-alone
language. It combines simple procedural syntax (similar to Pascal) with
powerful data description constructs based on associative arrays and
extensible semantics. It is dynamically typed, interpreted from bytecodes, and
has automatic memory management, making it ideal for configuration, scripting,
and rapid prototyping. It is implemented as a small library of C functions,
written in ANSI C, and compiles unmodified in all known platforms. The
implementation goals are simplicity, efficiency, portability, and low
embedding cost. It has been used on games such as Battle Mages, Vendetta,
FarCry, Homeworld2, and Painkiller.

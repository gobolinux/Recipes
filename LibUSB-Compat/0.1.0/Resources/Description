[Name] LibUSB-Compat
[Summary] Compability replacement for LibUSB 0.1
[Description] LibUSB-Compat is a replacement for LibUSB 0.1.
However, instead of being an actual implementation, LibUSB-Compat is
more of a compatibility layer (or wrapper) which just converts LibUSB
0.1 calls into their LibUSB 1.0 equivalents.

It aims to look, feel and behave exactly like LibUSB 0.1. As it is a
replacement, you cannot install it alongside LibUSB 0.1 on the same
system.

As the compatibility layer implements the exact same ABI and API, no
modifications to existing LibUSB 0.1-based applications are needed.
You do not even have to recompile them. This compatibility layer is a
drop-in replacement.

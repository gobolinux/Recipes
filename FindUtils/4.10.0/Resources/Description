[Description] The findutils package consists of three programs. `find' is a program which
searches a directory tree to find a file or group of files. It walks the
directory tree and reports all occurences of a file matching the user's
specifications. `locate' scans one or more databases of filenames and displays
any matches. `xargs' builds and executes command lines by gathering together
arguments it reads on the standard input. Most often, these arguments are lists
of file names generated by `find'.

[Name] GNU Wget
[Summary] A network utility to retrieve files from the Web.
[Description] GNU Wget is a utility for noninteractive download of 
files from the Web. It supports HTTP and FTP 
protocols, as well as retrieval through HTTP 
proxies. It can follow HTML links, download many 
pages, and convert the links for local viewing. It 
can also mirror FTP hierarchies or only those files 
that have changed. Wget has been designed for 
robustness over slow network connections; if a 
download fails due to a network problem, it will 
keep retrying until the whole file has been 
retrieved.

[Description]  To make access to the Linux kernel cpufreq subsystem easier for users and cpufreq userspace tools, a cpufrequtils package was created. It contains a library used by other programs (libcpufreq), command line tools to determine current CPUfreq settings and to modify them (cpufreq-info and cpufreq-set), and debug tools.))

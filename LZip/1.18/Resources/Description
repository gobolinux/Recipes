[Name] LZip
[Summary] Lzip is a lossless file compressor based on the LZMA algorithm.
[Description] Lzip is a lossless file compressor based on the LZMA (Lempel-Ziv-Markov
chain-Algorithm) algorithm designed by Igor Pavlov. The high compression
of LZMA comes from combining two basic, well-proven compression ideas:
sliding dictionaries (i.e. LZ77/78), and markov models (i.e. the thing
used by every compression algorithm that uses a range encoder or similar
order-0 entropy coder as its last stage) with segregation of contexts
according to what the bits are used for.

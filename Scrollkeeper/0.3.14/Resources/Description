[Description] ScrollKeeper is a cataloging system for
documentation on open systems. It manages
documentation metadata (as specified by the Open
Source Metadata Framework(OMF)) and provides a
simple API to allow help browsers to find, sort,
and search the document catalog. It will also be
able to communicate with catalog servers on the
Net to search for documents which are not on the
local system.

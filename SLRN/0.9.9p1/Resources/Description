[Description] slrn ('S-Lang read news') is a newsreader, i.e. a program that accesses a newsserver to read messages from the Internet News service (also known as 'Usenet'). It runs in console mode on various Unix-like systems (including Linux), 32-bit Windows, OS/2, BeOS and VMS. Beside the usual features of a newsreader slrn supports scoring rules to highlight, sort or kill articles based on information from their header. It is highly customizable, allows free key-bindings and can easily be extended using the sophisticated S-Lang macro language. Offline reading is possible by using either slrnpull (shipped with slrn) or a local newsserver (like leafnode or INN).

[Summary] Generate manual pages from program output
[Description] help2man is a tool for automatically generating simple manual pages from program output. It is intended to provide an easy way for software authors to include a manual page in their distribution without having to maintain that document. Given a program which produces reasonably standard --help and --version outputs, help2man will attempt to re-arrange that output into something which resembles a manual page.

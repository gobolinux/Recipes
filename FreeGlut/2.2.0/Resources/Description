[License] MIT/X Consortium License
[Description] freeglut is intended to be a 100% plug-compatible 
clone, and is released under the Xfree license. The 
GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit) is a widely used 
library for doing window control, keyboard, and 
mouse input, and other basic functions for OpenGL 
programs. However, GLUT is not OpenSourced - 
although it's source code is available under a 
somewhat ill-defined set of restrictions. 
Hence, 'freeglut'.

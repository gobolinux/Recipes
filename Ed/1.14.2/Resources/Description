[Description] GNU ed is a line-oriented text editor. It is used to  
create, display, modify and otherwise manipulate  
text files, both interactively and via shell scripts. A  
restricted version of 'ed', 'red', can only edit files in 
the current directory, and cannot execute shell  
commands. ed is the "standard" text editor in the  
sense that it is the original editor for UNIX, and 
thus widely available. For most purposes, however,  
it is superceded by full-screen editors such as  
Emacs, and Vi.

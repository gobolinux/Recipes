[Description] LZMA is the compression algorithm of 7zip without
the archiving or header features, thus comparable to gzip or bzip2.
Average compression ratio of LZMA is about 30% better than that
of gzip, and 15% better than that of bzip2. Decompression speed is only
a little slower than that of gzip, being two to five times faster than bzip2.
Very similar command line interface to gzip and bzip2.

[License] MIT/X Consortium License
[Description] Libungif is a library for reading and writing GIF images. It 
can load GIFs of all types but the save functionality uses an 
uncompressed GIF algorithm to avoid the Unisys LZW 
patent. This library is based on giflib and implements a 
superset of that library's API.

[Description] Procinfo-NG is replacement for procinfo that has most of the same features but is written in C++. It fixes many of the features that were broken due to changes in the 2.4 > 2.6 kernels. /proc is the kernel filesystem. This is a place you can go to acquire information from your running kernel.

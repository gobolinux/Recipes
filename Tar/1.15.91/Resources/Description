[Description] GNU `tar' saves many files together into a single  tape or disk archive, and can restore individual files  from the archive. It includes multivolume support,  the ability to archive sparse files, automatic archive  compression/decompression, remote archives and  special features that allow `tar' to be used for  incremental and full backups. It also includes `rmt',  the remote tape server (the `mt' tape drive control  program is in GNU `cpio').

[Name] mcpp
[Summary] A portable C preprocessor
[Description] mcpp is a portable C preprocessor and provides a validation suite to make thorough tests and evaluation of C/C++ preprocessors. When this validation suite is applied to various preprocessors, mcpp achieves a prominent result. mcpp not only has the highest conformance but also provides a variety of on-target diagnostic messages and #pragma directives to output debugging information. mcpp thus allows users to check almost all the preprocessing problems of source code.

[Summary] Library for accessing the Linux kernel's Direct Rendering Modules
[Description] The Direct Rendering Infrastructure, also known as the
DRI, is a framework for allowing direct access to graphics hardware
under the X Window System in a safe and efficient manner. It includes
changes to the X server, to several client libraries, and to the
kernel (DRM, Direct Rendering Manager).
LibDRM provides core library routines for the X Window System to
directly interface with video hardware using the Linux kernel's Direct
Rendering Modules.

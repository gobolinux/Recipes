[Name] LibRsync
[Summary] Library that implements the rsync remote-delta algorithm.
[Description] librsync is a free software library that implements the rsync
remote-delta algorithm. This algorithm allows efficient remote updates of a
file, without requiring the old and new versions to both be present at the
sending end. The library uses a "streaming" design similar to that of zlib
with the aim of allowing it to be embedded into many different applications.

[Description]  Linux bandwidth monitor (bwmon) is yet another utility that
measures bandwidth utiliazation per interface basis. It is coded in C and
takes advantage of POSIX thread and curses library. It runs only on Linux
systems since the utility reads /proc/net/dev and /proc/uptime.

The utility reads /proc/net/dev and /proc/uptime files in order to print out
bandwidth usage at user selected intervals, maximum bandwidth usage since
initialization of the utility and average bandwidth usage since the last
reboot. This is done per interface basis.

[Name] Foremost 
[Summary] A file recovery program
[License]
[Description] Foremost is a console program to recover files based 
on their headers, footers, and internal data structures. This 
process is commonly referred to as data carving. Foremost can work 
on image files, such as those generated by dd, Safeback, Encase, 
etc, or directly on a drive. The headers and footers can be 
specified by a configuration file or you can use command line 
switches to specify built-in file types. These built-in types 
look at the data structures of a given file format allowing for 
a more reliable and faster recovery.

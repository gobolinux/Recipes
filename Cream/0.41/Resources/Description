[Name] Cream
[Summary] Alternative Vim Configuration.
[Description] Vim [ext.link]  is a powerful and full-featured text editor, the popular descendant of the 1976 Vi text editor.

But Vim has a steep learning curve. It was not primarily designed to be easy to use, favoring performance and technical flexibility instead. Because it is so different, learning to use Vim takes time.

Cream shapes Vim into an interface you probably already know (sometimes called Common User Access [ext.link] ). Whether you are writing emails or developing large software applications, Cream saves you time and gets you up and running quickly.

+Unionfs 2.0 CONCEPTS:
+=====================
+
+This file describes the concepts needed by a namespace unification file
+system.
+
+Branch Priority:
+================
+
+Each branch is assigned a unique priority - starting from 0 (highest
+priority).  No two branches can have the same priority.
+
+
+Branch Mode:
+============
+
+Each branch is assigned a mode - read-write or read-only. This allows
+directories on media mounted read-write to be used in a read-only manner.
+
+
+Whiteouts:
+==========
+
+A whiteout removes a file name from the namespace. Whiteouts are needed when
+one attempts to remove a file on a read-only branch.
+
+Suppose we have a two-branch union, where branch 0 is read-write and branch
+1 is read-only. And a file 'foo' on branch 1:
+
+./b0/
+./b1/
+./b1/foo
+
+The unified view would simply be:
+
+./union/
+./union/foo
+
+Since 'foo' is stored on a read-only branch, it cannot be removed. A
+whiteout is used to remove the name 'foo' from the unified namespace. Again,
+since branch 1 is read-only, the whiteout cannot be created there. So, we
+try on a higher priority (lower numerically) branch and create the whiteout
+there.
+
+./b0/
+./b0/.wh.foo
+./b1/
+./b1/foo
+
+Later, when Unionfs traverses branches (due to lookup or readdir), it
+eliminate 'foo' from the namespace (as well as the whiteout itself.)
+
+
+Duplicate Elimination:
+======================
+
+It is possible for files on different branches to have the same name.
+Unionfs then has to select which instance of the file to show to the user.
+Given the fact that each branch has a priority associated with it, the
+simplest solution is to take the instance from the highest priority
+(numerically lowest value) and "hide" the others.
+
+
+Copyup:
+=======
+
+When a change is made to the contents of a file's data or meta-data, they
+have to be stored somewhere. The best way is to create a copy of the
+original file on a branch that is writable, and then redirect the write
+though to this copy. The copy must be made on a higher priority branch so
+that lookup and readdir return this newer "version" of the file rather than
+the original (see duplicate elimination).
+
+
+For more information, see <http://unionfs.filesystems.org/>.

+KNOWN Unionfs 2.0 ISSUES:
+=========================
+
+1. The NFS server returns -EACCES for read-only exports, instead of -EROFS.
+   This means we can't reliably detect a read-only NFS export.
+
+2. Modifying a Unionfs branch directly, while the union is mounted, is
+   currently unsupported.  We have tested Unionfs under such conditions, and
+   fixed any bugs we found (Unionfs comes with an extensive regression test
+   suite).  However, it may still be possible that changes made to lower
+   branches directly could cause cache incoherency which, in the worst case,
+   may case an oops.  We are currently addressing this problem for Unionfs
+   and also generically for all stackable file systems, by handing mmap and
+   introducing small VFS/MM changes that would allow a file system to handle
+   cache coherency correctly.
+
+   Unionfs 2.0 has a temporary workaround for this.  You can force Unionfs
+   to increase the superblock generation number, and hence purge all cached
+   Unionfs objects, which would then  be re-gotten from the lower branches.
+   This should ensure cache consistency.  To increase the generation number,
+   executed the command:
+
+	mount -t unionfs -o remount,incgen none MOUNTPOINT
+
+   Note that the older way of incrementing the generation number using an
+   ioctl, is no longer supported in Unionfs 2.0.  Ioctls in general are not
+   encouraged.  Plus, an ioctl is per-file concept, whereas the generation
+   number is a per-file-system concept.  Worse, such an ioctl requires an
+   open file, which then has to be invalidated by the very nature of the
+   generation number increase (read: the old generation increase ioctl was
+   pretty racy).
+
+3. Unionfs should not use lookup_one_len() on the underlying f/s as it
+   confuses NFS.  Currently, unionfs_lookup() passes lookup intents to the
+   lower file-system, this eliminates part of the problem.  The remaining
+   calls to lookup_one_len may need to be changed to pass an intent.
+
+
+For more information, see <http://unionfs.filesystems.org/>.

+Renaming directories:
+=====================

+the following sequence of events should take place:
+
+1) Remove whiteouts from both source and destination directory
+2) Rename source to destination
+3) Make destination opaque to prevent anything under it from showing up

+Unionfs is a stackable unification file system, which can appear to merge
+the contents of several directories (branches), while keeping their physical
+content separate.  Unionfs is useful for unified source tree management,
+merged contents of split CD-ROM, merged separate software package
+directories, data grids, and more.  Unionfs allows any mix of read-only and
+read-write branches, as well as insertion and deletion of branches anywhere
+in the fan-out.  To maintain Unix semantics, Unionfs handles elimination of
+duplicates, partial-error conditions, and more.
+
+# mount -t unionfs -o branch-option[,union-options[,...]] none MOUNTPOINT
+
+The available branch-option for the mount command is:
+
+	dirs=branch[=ro|=rw][:...]
+
+specifies a separated list of which directories compose the union.
+Directories that come earlier in the list have a higher precedence than
+those which come later. Additionally, read-only or read-write permissions of
+the branch can be specified by appending =ro or =rw (default) to each
+directory.
+
+Syntax:
+
+	dirs=/branch1[=ro|=rw]:/branch2[=ro|=rw]:...:/branchN[=ro|=rw]
+
+Example:
+
+	dirs=/writable_branch=rw:/read-only_branch=ro
+
+
+DYNAMIC BRANCH MANAGEMENT AND REMOUNTS
+======================================
+
+You can remount a union and change its overall mode, or reconfigure the
+branches, as follows.
+
+To downgrade a union from read-write to read-only:
+
+# mount -t unionfs -o remount,ro none MOUNTPOINT
+
+To upgrade a union from read-only to read-write:
+
+# mount -t unionfs -o remount,rw none MOUNTPOINT
+
+To delete a branch /foo, regardless where it is in the current union:
+
+# mount -t unionfs -o del=/foo none MOUNTPOINT
+
+To insert (add) a branch /foo before /bar:
+
+# mount -t unionfs -o remount,add=/bar:/foo none MOUNTPOINT
+
+To insert (add) a branch /foo (with the "rw" mode flag) before /bar:
+
+# mount -t unionfs -o remount,add=/bar:/foo=rw none MOUNTPOINT
+
+To insert (add) a branch /foo (in "rw" mode) at the very beginning (i.e., a
+new highest-priority branch), you can use the above syntax, or use a short
+hand version as follows:
+
+# mount -t unionfs -o remount,add=/foo none MOUNTPOINT
+
+To append a branch to the very end (new lowest-priority branch):
+
+# mount -t unionfs -o remount,add=:/foo none MOUNTPOINT
+
+To append a branch to the very end (new lowest-priority branch), in
+read-only mode:
+
+# mount -t unionfs -o remount,add=:/foo:ro none MOUNTPOINT
+
+Finally, to change the mode of one existing branch, say /foo, from read-only
+to read-write, and change /bar from read-write to read-only:
+
+# mount -t unionfs -o remount,mode=/foo=rw,mode=/bar=ro none MOUNTPOINT
+
+
+CACHE CONSISTENCY
+=================
+
+If you modify any file on any of the lower branches directly, while there is
+a Unionfs 2.0 mounted above any of those branches, you should tell Unionfs
+to purge its caches and re-get the objects.  To do that, you have to
+incremenet the generation number of the superblock using the following
+command:
+
+# mount -t unionfs -o remount,remount,incgen none MOUNTPOINT
+

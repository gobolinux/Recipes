+
+ Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
+                       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
+ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
+ of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
+
+			    Preamble
+
+  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
+freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
+License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
+software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
+General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
+Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
+using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
+the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
+your programs, too.
+
+  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
+price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
+have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
+this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
+if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
+in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
+
+  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
+anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
+These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
+distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
+
+  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
+gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
+you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
+source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
+rights.
+
+  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
+(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
+distribute and/or modify the software.
+
+  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
+that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
+software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
+want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
+that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
+authors' reputations.
+
+  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
+patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
+program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
+program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
+patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
+
+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
+modification follow.
+
+		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
+
+  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
+a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
+under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
+refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
+means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
+that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
+either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
+language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
+the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
+
+Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
+covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
+running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
+is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
+Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
+Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
+
+  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
+source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
+conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
+copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
+notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
+and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
+along with the Program.
+
+You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
+you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
+
+  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
+of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
+distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
+above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
+
+    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
+
+    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
+    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
+    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
+    parties under the terms of this License.
+
+    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
+    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
+    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
+    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
+    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
+    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
+    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
+    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
+    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
+    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
+
+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
+and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
+sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
+on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
+this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
+entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
+
+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
+collective works based on the Program.
+
+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
+with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
+a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
+the scope of this License.
+
+  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
+under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
+Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
+
+    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
+    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
+    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
+    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
+    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
+    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
+    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
+    customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
+    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
+    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
+    received the program in object code or executable form with such
+    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
+
+The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
+making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
+code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
+associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
+control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
+special exception, the source code distributed need not include
+anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
+form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
+operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
+itself accompanies the executable.
+
+If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
+access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
+access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
+distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
+compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
+
+  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
+except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
+otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
+void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
+However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
+this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
+parties remain in full compliance.
+
+  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
+distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
+modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
+the Program or works based on it.
+
+  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
+original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
+these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
+this License.
+
+  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
+may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
+refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
+
+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
+any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
+apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
+circumstances.
+
+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
+patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
+such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
+integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
+implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
+generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
+through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
+system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
+to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
+impose that choice.
+
+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
+be a consequence of the rest of this License.
+
+  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
+certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
+original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
+may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
+those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
+countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
+the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
+
+  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
+of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
+be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
+address new problems or concerns.
+
+Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
+specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
+later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
+either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
+Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
+this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
+Foundation.
+
+  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
+programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
+to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
+Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
+make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
+of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
+of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
+
+			    NO WARRANTY
+
+  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
+FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
+OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
+PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
+OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
+MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
+TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
+PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
+REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
+
+  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
+WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
+REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
+INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
+OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
+TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
+YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
+PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
+POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
+
+		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+
+	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
+
+  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
+possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
+free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
+
+  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
+to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
+convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
+the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
+
+    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
+    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
+
+    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
+    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
+    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
+    (at your option) any later version.
+
+    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
+    GNU General Public License for more details.
+
+    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
+    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
+    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
+
+
+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
+
+If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
+when it starts in an interactive mode:
+
+    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
+    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
+    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
+    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
+
+The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
+parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
+be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
+mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
+
+You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
+school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
+necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
+
+  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
+  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
+

+
+This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
+proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
+consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
+library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
+Public License instead of this License.

+
+2005-11-28  Arun M. Krishnakumar  <arunmk@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* inode.c: unionfs_lookup was not incrementing the reference

+
+2005-11-06  Josef "Jeff" Sipek  <jsipek@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* fist.h (lock_parent, unlock_dir): moved from now non-existent
+	missing_vfs_funcs.h
+	* inode.c (unionfs_create): use {,un}lock_rename instead of
+	double_{,un}lock

+
+2005-10-25  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* Makefile: Increment version to 1.1.2pre.
+	* regression/readdir.sh: readdir regression script.
+	It doesn't reproduce the bug for us, but extra tests can't hurt.
+
+	* dirfops.c (unionfs_readdir): Properly update uds_dirpos,
+	which fixes directory reading operations.
+
+2005-10-24  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* compat.[ch]: Remove old files.
+
+2005-10-24  Shaya Potter <spotter@cs.columbia.edu>

+
+2005-10-20  Shaya Potter <spotter@cs.columbia.edu>
+
+	* dirhelper.c (check_empty): Respect opaqueness.
+
+	* Replace lock_super around branch management operations with a
+	Unionfs read/write semaphore.  This will allow branchput/branchget
+	to operate concurrently, but prevent them from racing against
+	branchman operations.
+
+2005-10-19  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_permission): Don't call normal permission before
+	inode_permission (our modified version of permission), because it
+	just duplicates work.
+
+	* commonfops.c (branchput_gen): Lock the super when we read putmaps.
+
+	* inode.c (inode_permission): If NFS_SECURITY_HOLE is defined
+	treat -EACCESS as if we should fall back on inode_permission.
+
+	* branchman.c (unionfs_ioctl_rdwrbranch): Make super/dentry
+	lock/unlock symmetric.
+
+2005-10-18  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* NEWS: Updates NEWS file for release
+
+2005-10-14  Arun M. Krishnakumar  <arunmk@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* rename.c : Used the create_whiteout_parent function to
+	create the whiteout in unionfs_rename_all.
+	* subr.c : Brought the create_whiteout_parent back. These
+	squash Bug #442.
+
+2005-10-13  Arun M. Krishnakumar  <arunmk@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* rename.c : Fixed rest of Bug #425. Applied the patch
+	sent in by Junjiro Okajima.
+
+2005-10-13  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* rmdir-all.sh: added test for bug 430. Not sure if 
+	we are going to patch it yet but if we do the test
+	is there.
+	* regression/Makefile: added rmdircheckinode.c
+	* regression/progs/rmdircheckinode.c: program to check
+	if the inode numbers match after a failed rmdir.
+
+2005-10-13  Arun M. Krishnakumar  <arunmk@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* rename.c (unionfs_rename) : Fixed bug #425. The new_dentry
+	affects the unlink called by "mv" after the rename has failed.
+	It makes unlink return with -EISDIR. (partial fix)
+
+2005-10-11  Shaya Potter <spotter@cs.columbia.edu>
+
+	* dentry.c (unionfs_d_revalidate): Fix a deadlock.

+
+2005-09-28  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

+	permissions.
+
+2005-09-27  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* INSTALL: Document MODDIR.
+
+2005-09-23  Klaus Knopper  <unionfs@knopper.net>
+
+	* inode.c: added inode_permissions to check for permissions
+	on a file even if its on an ROFS and used it in
+	unionfs_permissions
+
+2005-09-22  Josef "Jeff" Sipek  <jsipek@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* Makefile: remove 'tags' target dependency from 'all'
+
+2005-09-21  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* Makefile: forgot to remove locks.c from source list
+
+2005-09-21  Junjiro Okajima <hooanon05@yahoo.co.jp>
+

+
+2005-09-20  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* removed locking code from codebase since we no longer
+	handle locking (vfs will do it)
+
+2005-09-18  Josef "Jeff" Sipek  <jsipek@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* removed 2.4 code from fist.h, inode.c, lookup.c,
+	persistent_inode.c, rdstate.c
+
+2005-09-18  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* removed 2.4 code from copyup.c, dentry.c, dirfops.c 
+	and file.c
+
+2005-09-18  Josef "Jeff" Sipek  <jsipek@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* removed 2.4 code from stale_inode.c, subr.c, unionfs.h,
+	unlink.c, xattr.c
+
+2005-09-17  Josef "Jeff" Sipek  <jsipek@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* removed 2.4 code from main.c, print.c, super.c,
+	xattr.c
+
+2005-09-17  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* removed 2.4 code from branchman.c, commonfops.c
+
+2005-09-16  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* Makefile.kernel: Use EXTRA_CFLAGS.
+
+	* Makefile: Use ${LD} instead of ld, for cross compilation.
+
+2005-09-15  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* Makefile: Updated to 1.1.0pre
+	* Makefile.kernel: Updated to 1.1.0pre
+
+2005-09-15  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* NEWS: Updated for release.
+	* Makefile: updated for release.
+	* Makefile.kernel: updated for release
+
+2005-09-12  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* locks.c: Removed locking code since its broken big define 0 around
+	it
+	* file.c: Removed locking references have the vfs handle it.
+	* unionfs.h: fixed bug with 2.4 compilation.
+
+2005-09-08  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* main.c: Remove comment leftover from templates that doesn't make
+	sense in current context.
+
+2005-09-05  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* commonfops.c: Remove lower fput debug printks.
+
+2005-09-02  Shaya Potter <spotter@cs.columbia.edu>
+
+	* file.c (unionfs_mmap): Fix flag checking for mmap.
+
+2005-09-01  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* We shouldn't use d_delete, vfs_unlink already does it.  The only
+	known remaining 2.6.13 issue is the unionfs_lock (flock.sh in the
+	regression suite).
+
+	* inode.c,stale_inode.c: Support for 2.6.13's new follow_link
+	prototype.  However, many of the regression tests fail for
+	unrelated reasons (or at least I think they are unrelated).
+
+	* unionctl.c: Allow --FOO to go before the union specifier (e.g.,
+	unionctl --list /mnt/unionfs now works).
+	* lookup.c: Don't partial lookup the root dentry.
+
+	* copyup.c: Check for permission setting errors.
+
+2005-08-31  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* lookup_one_len never returns NULL.
+
+2005-08-30  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_permission): Simplified code.
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_link): Copy directory attrs to directory
+	(BUG391).  Unfortunately, regression test doesn't quite catch the
+	bug because of a revalidate for the stat.
+	* commit: Don't complain about .sh file's indentation.
+
+2005-08-29  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* INSTALL: tmpfs doesn't support fsync on directories
+
+	* Makefile: Update release target for new directory structure.
+
+	* patch-kernel.sh: Depend on Experimental, and move configuration
+	option to File Systems -> Miscellaneous file systems at the end,
+	not as the very first file system. Add UNIONFS_VERSION define.
+	Use tail -n +7 instead of tail +7.
+
+	* file.c (unionfs_fsync): Don't use dtohd on unlocked dentries.
+
+2005-08-28  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_link): Don't use unionfs_interpose with
+	INTERPOSE_LINK any more, because only one line of the whole
+	function was being used anyway.  This fixes an inode refcount leak
+	in unionfs_link, so the regression suite now passes with the new
+	locking, without any leaks.
+
+	* commonfops.c (unionfs_file_release): Update rdstate access time when
+	saving it in the inode (so that it won't be so quickly discarded).
+
+2005-08-26  Arun M. Krishnakumar  <arunmk@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* dirfops.c (unionfs_readdir) : removed the changes made
+	for the special way in which vfs_llseek was handles for
+	Reiser4, as Reiser4 introduced a patch which made it
+	behave properly.
+
+2005-08-26  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* Passes regression tests.
+
+	* Locking for create_parents.  Regression tests from branchman to
+	open.sh PASS.
+
+	* Basic inode operations pass sniff test with new locking (regression
+	tests not yet tried).
+
+	* Dentries need locking, and there isn't much way around it.This
+	snapshot adds some untested locking, and you won't want to use it
+	yet.  The basic principles are:
+		1. As soon as a VFS operation that touches a dentry is entered,
+		the dentry should be locked.
+		2. The lock ordering is:
+			Children before parents
+			Two children are tie broken with their address
+	There are several functions not done yet, most notably create_parents,
+	because it is going to require more thought (we walk up the parent
+	list and then back down it).  This in part is why children need to go
+	before parents (also revalidate walks up the parent list).
+
+2005-08-25  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* xattr.c: unused label causing a warning and inturn an error.
+
+2005-08-25  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* main.c (interpose,reinterpose): Interposition should lock the dentry.
+
+	* file.c: CodingStyle, and we don't need to check ftopd before ftohf.
+	* file.c (unionfs_mmap): We were checking our file instead of the lower
+	-level file for having valid operations.
+	* dirfops.c,dirhelper.c: CodyingStyle
+
+	* copyup.c: There is no need for _len at the end of functions, because
+	other versions don't exist any longer.
+
+	* lookup.c (unionfs_lookup_backend): Lock the dentry private data
+	for the whole lookup routine.
+	* branchman.c: CodingStyle fixes.
+	* rdstate.c, super.c: Use KERN_ERR if we have unfreed objects.
+
+2005-08-25  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* INSTALL: Fix losetup instructions.
+
+2005-08-24  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* print.c: Avoid kmallocs.
+	* rdstate.c,dirfops.c: Code style cleanups.
+
+2005-08-24  Anton Farygin  <rider@altlinux.com>
+
+	* dentry.c (d_revalidate):  Lock inode when freeing lower level ones.
+
+2005-08-24  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+	* unionfs.h: Updated forwardmap version and added a new data
+	structure bmapent.(Later on these should be unified into one header
+	rather than being in 2 header files).
+	* persistant_inode.c: Updated code to use bmapents now.
+
+2005-08-24  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* unionimap.c: Added code to ensure you dont add a filesystem with
+	the same fsid twice (no duplicate entries in the maps).
+	* unionimap.h: Added a new data structrue bmapent.
+	* The code in the kernel to read the maps hasent been changed so it
+	doesent work yet. Check back soon for that.
+
+2005-08-24  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_create): Use proper permissions when recreating
+	a deleted file (BUG383).
+
+2005-08-23  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* commonfops.c (copyup_deleted_file): Fix leak of name on subsequent
+	loop iterations.
+
+	* commonfops.c (copyup_deleted_file): Cleanup of major loop.
+
+	* unionfs.h (DPUT,KFREE): Don't try to free errors.
+
+	* main.c (unionfs_reinterpose): Remove d_unhashed assertion.
+	* unionfs.h (d_deleted): Create an inline function to tell
+	if a directory is deleted (i.e., unhashed and not the root).
+
+2005-08-23  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* main.c (unionfs_parse_options): More checking for copyupmode.
+
+2005-08-22  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* unionfs.h (get_nlinks): More intelligent link counting.
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_create): Don't dput an IS_ERR.
+
+	* unionfs.h: sbstart is always zero
+	* main.c (unionfs_read_super): check_branch does existence checking
+
+	* unionfs_debugmacros.h: Fix stray printks.
+
+	The following fixes are so that the regression suite runs without
+	any memory or dentry leaks:
+	* branchman.c (unionfs_ioctl_addbranch): Zero newly allocated
+	arrays.
+	* copyup.c (unionfs_create_named_dirs): Fix leak of path stack.
+	* main.c: Handle get_parent.
+	* lookup.c: Make the logic to put preceding negative dentries a
+	function.
+	* unlink.c (unionfs_unlink_all): Fix dentry reference count leak.
+	* inode.c (unionfs_link): Properly handle lock_ and unlock_dir.
+	* match-dget.pl: Handle DS and DD for set and unset records.
+
+2005-08-20  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* INSTALL: sendfile conflicts w/ Unionfs.
+
+2005-08-19  Arun M. Krishnakumar  <arunmk@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* dirfops.c (unionfs_readdir) : changed the way the
+	return value of the repeated vfs_llseek (with origin
+	=1) is used. this is to allow readdir in Reiser4,
+	which returns -ENOENT (!!!) for the llseek in same
+	cases. this is for Bug #358
+
+2005-08-18  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* match-dget.pl: Insert both gets and puts into list of actions
+	for unreleased dentries.
+
+	* match-dget.pl: Dget matching script.
+	* Use DGET, DPUT, DENTRY_OPEN, and LOOKUP_ONE_LEN to
+	record when we dget and dput dentries.
+
+2005-08-17  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* match-malloc.pl: Return number of errors.
+
+	* print.c (fist_print_generic_dentry): Print inode number.

+
+2005-08-15  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* print.c (fist_print_file): Divide into generic and Unionfs halves,
+	ASSERT if we are passed a lower-level file.
+
+	* file.c (unionfs_lock): Handle write locks on r/o branches.
+
+2005-03-03  Anton Farygin  <rider@altlinux.com>
+
+	* dentry.c (unionfs_d_revalidate): Fix possible double unlock.
+
+	* branchman.c (unionfs_ioctl_incgen): Fix possible deadlock when
+	memory allocation fails.
+
+2005-08-12  Arun M. Krishnakumar  <arunmk@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* rename.c, commonfops.c : removed the
+	dget/dput functions sandwiching the vfs_unlink as
+	these raise the refcounts and cause the .nfsXYZ
+	files to get created after unlinks. This knocks
+	out Bug#364 for 2.6.
+
+2005-08-11  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* main.c (unionfs_parse_dirs): Prevent recursive Unionfs mounts.
+

+	a persistant inode scheme for unionfs.
+	* main.c : modified parse options for persistant inodes. Not done yet
+
+2005-05-11  Jaspreet Singh  <jsingh@ensim.com>
+
+	* copyup.c (unionfs_copyup_xattrs): Don't use XATTR_CREATE,
+	instead use 0 so that it is replaced or created as needed
+	(Selinux automatically creates attributes.
+
+2005-05-11  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* print.c (fist_print_generic_dentry): ASSERT(d_count > 0) so
+	that we find dentries gone bad earlier rather than later.
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_mkdir): bend should not go past the opaque
+	directory, but stay there.
+
+2005-05-10  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* INSTALL: Add root file system instructions based on Linux
+	Live's linuxrc.
+
+2005-05-08  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* main.c,super.c,lookup.c: Use alloc_inode in 2.6, so that only
+	two allocations need to be made per inode instead of two.  In
+	both 2.4 and 2.6 use a private kmem_cache for our dentry data,
+	so that we don't need to waste space by having kmalloc round up.
+
+	* lookup.c (new_dentry_private_data): Merge initialization and
+	reinitialization code from lookup and read_super.  Also don't
+	reallocate dentry private data if we already have enough space.
+
+	* INSTALL: Add Jaspreet Singh's selinux instructions.
+
+	* INSTALL: Add EXDEV on ro branch rename as a limitation.
+
+	* inode.c: follow_link and put_link fix for 2.6.
+
+	* lookup.c: Compile fix for 2.4.
+
+	* rename.c: If a directory is moved on a read-only branch return EXDEV,
+	so that mv essentially does a cp -r (recursive copyup in the kernel
+	would be too ugly).
+
+2005-05-06  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* lookup.c: Merge unionfs_lookup_backend and unionfs_partial_lookup,
+	partial lookups will now properly handle whiteouts.
+
+	* print.c: Fix compile error when NODEBUG is defined.
+
+	* lookup.c: Fix BUG 264.
+	* print.c: Separate generic inode printing from itohi printing.
+	Use const for print functions.
+
+2005-05-05  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* Code style fixes.
+
+2005-04-27  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* inode.c changed ops vectors to C99 style initialization.
+	* file.c changed ops vectors to C99 style initialization.
+	* dentry.c changed ops vectors to C99 style initialization.
+	* super.c changed ops vectors to C99 style initialization.
+	* stale_inode.c changed ops vectors to C99 style initialization.
+
+2005-04-21  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* unionfs.h: added no check versions ot set_dtohd_index
+	and dtohd_index.
+	* dentry.c: changed a function call to dtohd_index_nocheck
+
+2005-04-26  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* lookup.c (unionfs_lookup_backend): When a whiteout is encountered,
+	set opauqeness as we do with opaque directories, to prevent partial
+	lookup from seeing past the whiteout.
+
+	* lookup.c: Separate file for lookup code.
+	* subr.c: Move unionfs_partial_lookup to lookup.c.
+	* inode.c: Move unionfs_lookup to lookup.c:
+
+	* rename.c: Don't print lower-level dentries using a Unionfs
+	specific function.
+
+	* print.c: Divide fist_print_dentry into one function for Unionfs
+	specific dentries, and then a generic function.  Also ASSERT that
+	we are really printing a Unionfs dentry (so we don't dereference
+	bad private data).
+
+	* Fix indentation comments.
+
+2005-04-25  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* subr.c: Code style fixes.
+
+2005-04-22  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* NEWS: Keep NEWS up to date.
+
+2005-04-21  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* file.c (unionfs_filldir): Don't strncmp for .wh., if the
+	name's length is less than 4.  Old cruft can make things
+	go horribly bad (BUG 254).
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_lookup_backend): Properly handle file
+	transitioning from a negative to a positive dentry. (BUG 215)
+
+2005-04-21  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* file.c: Sendfile only exists on 2.6.
+	* main.c: Catch UNIONFS_REVAL_NEG specifically, still
+	need to understand/fix.
+
+2005-04-20  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* subr.c (unionfs_partial_lookup) ,unionfs.h
+	(unionfs_dentry_info), inode.c(unionfs_lookup):
+	Correctly mark a directory as opaque and respect that
+	during partial lookups.
+
+	* Exorcise struct typedefs and "fake" STATIC functions.
+
+	* inode.c: Experimental support for opaque directories,
+	not all of the loose ends are tied up, so this snapshot
+	will have some associated oddities.
+
+	* xattr.c: Use EOPNOTSUPP, not ENOTSUPP.
+
+	* Makefile, unionfs.h: Separation of rename/unlink code.
+	* rename.c: Separate rename code from inode.c
+	* unlink.c: Separate unlink code from inode.c
+
+2005-04-20  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* rdstate.c, unionfs.h: DOH, We were checking if
+	uii_rdversion <= MAXRDCOOKIE to decide whether or not
+	to wrap uii_cookie.
+
+2005-04-19  Fabian Franz  <fs-bugs@fabian-franz.de>
+
+	* applied patch to file.c that uses generic_file_sendfile
+	to implement sendfile.
+

+	commands, which are not defined on amd64.
+
+2005-04-18  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* copyup.c: Extended attributes now copyup properly.
+	This has only been tested in 2.6 but I see no reason
+	that it shouldent work in 2.4
+	* copyup.c: unionfs_create_dirs is now nolonger bound
+	by MAX_DIRS_CREATE. We now use kmalloc to dynamically
+	allocate memory for it and "realloc" the memory when
+	needed.
+
+2005-04-18  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* copyup.c: Use list_size as the argument to xattr_free, not the
+	MAX_LIST_SIZE.
+
+	* file.c: ASSERT was asserting on the dentry, not the i_mode.
+
+2005-04-16  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* file.c: Delay copyup of read-write files located on read-only
+	branches, until an operation will actually write to them (BUG 225).
+
+	* INSTALL: Cleanup kernel instructions a bit.
+
+2005-04-13  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* inode.c: unionfs_mkdir now spoofes the uid and gid of the owner
+	of the whiteout file for the purpose of removing it.
+
+2005-04-11  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+	* patch-kernel.sh : Script written to move unionfs into the kernel
+	source tree. The original script was submitted by Sven Geggus however
+	the script was cleaned up and modified for various reasons. Check the
+	file for more details.
+	* Makefile: PHONY added to the utils target to aid in building them
+	for the kernel.
+	* INSTALL: Directions added for building unionfs into a monolithic kernel.
+
+2005-04-11  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

+
+2005-03-21  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* Add big warnings that NFS exports won't work in 1.0.10.

+
+2005-03-15  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* super.c (unionfs_statfs) : df now reports the proper numbers.
+	duplicate super blocks are not factored into the calculations and
+	all the block sizes are normalized to the first partition.
+
+2005-03-14  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* main.c (unionfs_read_super) : In 2.4 the kernel expects a valid
+	super block or null we were returning an error pointer and this
+	caused an Oops. This has been fixed.
+
+2005-03-10  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* unionfs_getlk (unionfs_getlk): Add preprocessor define for

+	work.
+	* locks.c (unionfs_setlk,unionfs_getlk): locks.c was added to house
+	locking functions so file.c doesent get overcrowded. unionfs_setlk
+	and unionfs_getlk were added and placed in this file with some
+	helper functions for 2.6
+
+2005-03-08  Terry Barnaby <terry1@beam.ltd.uk>

+	finding and patching this bug.
+
+	* main.c (unionfs_interpose): Reorganize if statement.

+
+	* Applied patch to bug 193 Fixed the problem with
+	hardlinks not having the same inode number.
+
+2005-02-22  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* dentry.c (unionfs_d_delete): d_delete should not be defined (or

+2005-02-22  Fabian Franz  <fs-bugs@fabian-franz.de>
+
+	* copyup.c (unionfs_copyup_dentry_len): Applied patch provided

+
+2005-02-08  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

+
+	* Makefile added a target for uninstall to accomodate rpm removal
+
+2005-02-02  Anton Farygin  <rider@altlinux.com>
+
+	* copyup.c (unionfs_copyup_permissions): Use ATTR_FORCE to make
+	sure any user can change permissions.
+	* copyup.c (unionfs_create_dirs): Twiddle current->fsuid/fsgid
+	so that any user's copyup will behave properly.
+
+2005-02-02  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* file.c (unionfs_mmap): Don't ASSERT that the lower mmap
+	operation is there, instead return ENODEV, as is done in
+	do_mmap_pgoff.  NTFS (and others) don't support mmap, so

+
+2005-02-01  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* dirhelper.c : fixed 2.6 compilation. call to vfs_creat missing

+
+2005-01-26  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* rdstate.c, unionfs.h: Move finding and adding filldir nodes
+	into rdstate.c.  This reduced the readdir code size, and should
+	also let us reuse the code for the subr.c functions.
+	* subr.c: Use an rdstate instead of a second readdir to remove
+	files in delete_whiteouts.
+	* namei.c: Removed vfs_unlink_nozombie.
+
+2005-01-19  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* INSTALL: Add more CFLAGS options to make things smaller.

+
+2005-01-14  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* copyup.c (unionfs_copyup_permissions): Changed so it actually works now
+	instead of corrupting certian bits.
+	* copyup.c (unionfs_create_dirs): Function actually uses unionfs_copyup_permissions
+	for setting directory permissions instead of setting them explicitly.
+
+2005-01-14  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* file.c (unionfs_dir_llseek): Allow llseek to the current
+	offset in the directory, but nowhere else.
+	* file.c (unionfs_readdir): Save the last offset, so we
+	can lseek to it (for pretend).
+
+	* Remove all occurrences of GFP_KERNEL and replace with GFP_NOFS,
+	so our allocations can't cause file system calls.
+
+2005-01-13  Rakesh N. Iyer  <riyer@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* file.c (unionfs_readdir): Fixed deadlock in rdstate search.
+
+2005-01-13  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* Split README into INSTALL as well.
+
+	* Makefile: Spit out a message saying to read install.

+
+	* doit.sh: Call optional postdoit script
+
+2005-01-10  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* AUTHORS file.
+
+	* README updates.
+
+	* Allow NFS exports on 2.6 (Sai Suman)
+	* Fixes to print format in xattr.c (Sai Suman)
+
+	* debian/*: Debian packaging from Alex de Landgraaf.
+
+	* Remove -Wno-unused-label for gcc 2.9.5 (alex@delandgraaf.com).
+	* Allow "EXTRACFLAGS=-DNODEBUG" in fistdev.mk to disable
+	the printing/ASSERT facility, cutting object size in half.
+
+2005-01-09  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

+2005-01-07  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* Prepare 1.0.6 release.
+
+	* Fix 2.6 compile issues in new code.
+
+	* rdstate.c: Move readdir state away from subr.c.
+	Use a kmem_cache for filldir nodes.
+
+	* copyup.c: Move copyup functions away from subr.c
+
+2005-01-06  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* file.c: Working NFS readdir.  On close we store left-over
+	readdir state in the inode for up to 5 seconds.  If a readdir
+	has a matching cookie, then we pull the state out of the inode
+	and use it.  We also needed to use our own offsets, otherwise
+	the NFS client got confused.
+
+	* subr.c: Remember the number of entries in our hash table for
+	each inode, and use that as the number for the next readdir.
+
+	* Makefile: Fix dependencies on .h files.
+
+	* print.c: Consistencify printing of files and superblocks
+	and shorten some overly verbose output that added no information,
+	but reduced the effective kernel log size.
+
+	* fist.h: Make gcc check fist_dprint_internal formats.
+
+	* file.c,unionfs.h: Separate readdir state into a separate structure.
+
+	* file.c,unionfs.h,subr.c: Make readdir state use variable sized
+	hash tables based on number of pages in lower-level directories.
+
+	* Makefile: Install unionfs.ko, not unionfs.o if it exists.
+
+	* main.c: Remove MODULE_PARM because it is deprecated.
+
+2005-01-04  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* file.c (unionfs_read): Fix "inifite" cat bug on 2.6
+
+	* Makefile: Auto-select 2.4 vs. 2.6 for build.
+
+	* Unify 2.4 and 2.6 Makefiles
+
+	* Fixes for printing file structures at debug level 18.
+
+	* Fixes for 2.4 compilation.

+	* inode.c: Embed rename.txt into comment.
+
+2004-12-29  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* inode.c, unionfs.h: Changed directory copyup function back to
+	old prototype.
+
+	* subr.c (unionfs_copyup_dentry_len): Handle directories, devices,
+	and symlinks.
+
+2004-12-27  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* inode.c: Only request copyup of parent directories.
+
+	* subr.c (unionfs_copyup_dentry_len): Handle directory copyup
+	(required for chmod).
+
+	* main.c (unionfs_parse_options): Fix along error path.
+
+2004-12-06  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* main.c (unionfs_interpose): Allow mount point crossing.
+
+	* README, Makefile, inode.c: Turn off extended attributes, unless
+	the user specifically turns them back on by defining UNIONFS_XATTR.
+	This prevents us from getting various compile errors depending on
+	vendor-specific patches.
+
+2004-11-10  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* Fix .cvsignore and release.
+
+	* README: Added warning that anything less than 2.4.20 is unsupported.
+
+	* namei.c: Removed inode_dir_notify calls when we are on less than

+
+	* Makefile: Include man pages in the release.
+
+2004-11-07  Erez Zadok  <ezk@cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* released unionfs-1.0.
+
+	* announce-email.txt: revised announcement text.
+
+2004-09-23  Erez Zadok  <ezk@cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* announce-email.txt: draft announcement email.
+
+	* README: revised.
+
+2004-09-15  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* file.c: Don't allocate directory hash table for files.
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_setattr): Don't do partial lookup if setattr is not
+	set to all (should improve delete_whiteout).
+
+	* Some grayout code (we don't discuss rename_first anymore, so it
+	actually doesn't matter).
+
+2004-08-24  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* namei.c (vfs_create_nozombie): Whiteout creation needs a version
+	of vfs_create that won't down the i_zombie.
+
+	* subr.c (create_dir_whs_filldir):  Don't ASSERT that the whiteout
+	doesn't already exist, because we can have multiple files with
+	the same name in other branches.
+
+2004-08-23  Mohammad Nayyer Zubair  <zubair@filer.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_mkdir, unionfs_symlink, unionfs_mknod): lookup
+	whiteout in 'bstart' not 'bindex'. We always looked up on first branch
+	as bindex was set to 0
+
+2004-08-20  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_inode_revalidate): Walk up the tree to revalidate
+	inodes like we do for dentries.
+
+	* inode.c, subr.c, unionfs.h: Use multilocks to protect against
+	unionfs_partial_lookup and revalidate operations racing against
+	each other.
+
+	* unionfs.h: Implementation of "multilocks".
+
+	* Makefile: install target
+
+	* We don't change size, so no sca_*.[ch] files.
+
+	* main.c (unionfs_hidden_dentry_index): This function is unused now
+	that Mohammad took it out, so I removed it.
+
+	* Removed unnecessary files.
+
+	* COPYING: SUNY we can't be blamed for anything notice; and the GPL.
+
+2004-08-19  Mohammad Nayyer Zubair  <zubair@filer.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_setattr): using dtohd_index() instead of
+	unionfs_hidden_dentry() because an intermediate hidden dentry
+	could be NULL and we dont want PASSERT to oops on us
+
+2004-08-19  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_unlink_all): We shouldn't have negative dentries
+	unless they are the first one.
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_inode_revalidate): PASSERT(hidden_inode) instead
+	of Oopsing.
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_rename_all): Typo in the clobbering unlink.
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_rename_all): No debug printks.
+
+	* unionfs.h (get_nlinks): Don't sum up non-directories.
+
+	* subr.c (unionfs_refresh_hidden_dentry): Re-lookup a dentry, this
+	is needed on rename reverts because vfs_rename trashes the dentry
+	of the target.
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_rename_all): Working revert.
+
+2004-08-18  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_rename_all): New rename that handles more cases,
+	revert code doesn't work yet.
+
+2004-08-18  Mohammad Nayyer Zubair  <zubair@filer.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* inode.c (rmdir_all): exit if error is not -EROFS and not -ENOTEMPTY
+
+	* inode.c (rmdir_all): exit from function and dont create whiteout
+	if vfs_rmdir returns error other than -EROFS
+
+
+2004-08-17  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_unlink_all): Unlock the directory on error.
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_setattr): Lock on all attribute changes, not just
+	some.
+
+	* inode.c (do_rename): Check renames based on index rather than
+	new_dentry which might not exist.
+
+	* Makefile: debugging symbols are very useful for Oops tracing
+
+	* unionfs.h (CUR_MAX_BRANCH): Removed CUR_MAX_BRANCH which was always
+	sbend + 1, and replaced with sbmax (that doesn't require a redundant
+	and possbly inconsistent field within the super-block).
+
+	* unionfs.h (dtopd): Converted from a macro to an inline function
+	so that we can do more checking of the private data that we are
+	returning.
+
+	* unionfs.h (dtohd_index) Added a udi_bcount field to the private data
+	so we would Oops rather than silently overflow array bounds.
+
+	* dentry.c: Recursively revalidate the parent (the ASSERT that was
+	checking this was mis-written).  It turns out that our parent was not
+	always valid.
+
+	* file.c (unionfs_file_revalidate): Always reassign the read-ahead
+	values because the older file might have different values and llseek
+	will cause an assertion failure.
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_lookup_backend): Treat revalidated negative and
+	positive dentries differently.
+
+2004-08-16  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* inode.c: Use an fd_set instead of an integer for tracking successful
+	renames.
+
+	* branchman.c: Don't allow more than FD_SETSIZE (1024) branches.
+
+	* unionctl.c: Specific message for exceeding FD_SETSIZE.
+
+2004-08-11  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* inode.c: Return ENAMETOOLONG when looking up ".wh.*"
+
+	* unionctl.c: Add ioctl.
+
+	* branchman.c: Don't allow branches without MAY_READ
+
+	* unionctl.c: Convert branch pathnames into index automatically.
+
+	* unionctl.c: Match the longest prefix of our path inside of
+	/proc/mounts instead of the path itself.  This is required so that
+	remove doesn't need to open the root of the union.
+
+	* unionctl.c: Remove branch ioctl and list branch configuration.
+
+2004-08-10  Mohammad Nayyer Zubair  <zubair@filer.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* file.c: added CAP_SYS_ADMIN checks before calling unionfs ioctls
+
+	* uniondbg.c: now contains debugging related ioctls
+
+	* unionctl.c: now contains ioctls to add, remove and set branch
+	permissions moved here
+
+	* uniondbg.c: ioctls to add, remove and set branch permissions
+	moved here
+
+	* fist_ioctl.c: remaining ioctls stay here
+
+	* subr.c: making sure copyupuid, copyupgid and copyupmode are all
+	specified when copyup option is set to mounter.
+
+	* inode.c: implemented unionfs_rename_first()
+
+2004-08-09  Mohammad Nayyer Zubair  <zubair@filer.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* inode.c: more places where we should exit if get an error other than
+	-EROFS in unlink/rmdir and related functions.
+
+	* subr.c: exit if get an error other than -EROFS when
+	creating/deleting whiteouts
+
+	* inode.c: making sure that we create/mkdir/symlink/mknod to the
+	left only if the error returned is -EROFS, otherwise passup
+
+	* subr.c: use notify_change instead of directly modifying the inode
+	fields.
+
+	* subr.c: use notify_change instead of directly modifying the inode
+	fields.
+
+	* main.c: added copyupuid, copyupgid and copyupmode mount options.
+	These options will specify the mode, uid and gid of copied-up files.
+	copyup option should be set to mounter.
+
+	* subr.c: using the above mount time values for copied-up files.
+
+	* unionfs.h added these values in the unionfs super block.
+
+2004-06-17  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* file.c (unionfs_flush): Flush all branches (only makes a
+	difference for directories).
+
+2004-08-03  Mohammad Nayyer Zubair  <zubair@filer.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* super.c: Implemented unionfs_show_options. Can now view unionfs
+	mount time options in /proc/mounts
+
+	* inode.c: using is_robranch_super instead of is_robranch in
+	create, mkdir, symlink, mknod operations, whenever we try to
+	remove whiteouts if they exist.
+
+	* main.c: while parsing options using strcmp wherever we can,
+	removed all magic numbers, copyup options are now preserve,
+	currentuser, mounter
+
+	* subr.c: when copying up the default mode should be original
+	owner (preserve)
+
+2004-08-02  Mohammad Nayyer Zubair  <zubair@filer.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* main.c: unionfs mount time flag changed from being an integer
+	flag to several text options that will together make up the flag.
+
+2004-05-17  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* branchman.c: Fixed off by one error when adding more than 8
+	branches.
+
+2004-05-10  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@polarbear.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* main.c (unionfs_read_super): Error check to prevent oops on bad
+	mount-time options.
+
+2004-04-21  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@polarbear.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* file.c: revalidate files when the are passed into our methods,
+	this allows copy-up of open files.  Yeah snapshots.
+
+	* dentry.c: Should not use d_hash and d_compare because Unionfs is
+	in charge of the namespace, not the lower-level file systems.
+
+	* Unionfs now has split-view caches.  If compiled with
+	-DSPLIT_VIEW_CACHES, then Unionfs supports duplicating the super
+	block structure and dynamically selecting the correct structure to
+	use when crossing into the unionfs mountpoint.  Right now the
+	default behavior is that root has one view, and every other user
+	has another view.
+
+	If the super block is not duplicated then everything works as
+	before.
+
+2004-04-20  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@polarbear.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* branchman.c: Super Duper works!  An ioctl can let you create a
+	super block that is a copy of the original.  When you stat the
+	mountpoint that super block is returned.  Now to fix the reference
+	counting bugs associated with unmount. :)
+
+2004-04-19  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@arcticfox.foo>
+
+	* super.c (unionfs_select_super): return s_root for now
+
+2004-03-15  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@arcticfox.foo>
+
+	* dentry.c (unionfs_d_revalidate): Fix refcounts.
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_inode_revalidate): Fix reference counting.
+
+	* inode revalidate "works" (e.g., no Oopses or other broken f/s
+	behavior), but has broken reference counting.
+
+2004-03-14  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@arcticfox.foo>
+
+	* main.c (unionfs_interpose): Changed neg_dent_flag to which was
+	true if we did *not* have a negative dentry to is_negative_dentry
+	which *is* true if we have a negative dentry.  Fixed related
+	assert (which was ASSERT(1)).
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_lookup): Read through and simplified lookup by
+	removing duplicated code or nasty if/else statements when if
+	continue would work(to the tune of 20%).  Clarified comments as
+	well.  Now instead of being a 248 line monster it is a 199 line
+	monster.
+
+	* UNIONFS-TODO: We still need to solve whiteouts (i.e., you can
+	sucessfully stat a whiteout in Unionfs).  Note this is not
+	introduced by my changes.
+
+2004-03-12  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* branchman.c (unionfs_ioctl_rdwrbranch): Read/write branch setting.
+
+2004-03-11  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* branchman.c (unionfs_ioctl_addbranch): Refcount fix.
+
+2004-03-04  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* inode.c (do_rename): Correctly check is_readonly.
+
+	* fist.h (print_exit_pointer): Print out pointer using %p and
+	don't convert using PTR_ERR if it is not IS_ERR.
+
+	* subr.c (unionfs_create_parent_dir): Return error as pointer
+
+	* subr.c (create_whiteout): Check branch before creating whiteouts.
+
+	* unionfs.h (VALID_MOUNT_FLAGS): Define valid mount flags in the
+	header, so main.c doesn't need to know all of them.
+
+	* doit.sh (FLAG): Default mode should be UNLINK_ALL, not
+	UNLINK_WHITEOUT.
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_unlink): Unlink creates whiteout to the left.
+
+2004-03-03  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@polarbear.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_create): Creation on a robranch will
+	cause the file to be created to the left.
+
+	* unionfs.h: More macros for checking if things are on read-only
+	branches.
+
+	* xattr.c: Separate xattrs from inode.c.
+
+	* ATTACH-TODO.txt: Unionfs doesn't attach.
+
+	* README.attach: Unionfs doesn't attach.
+
+	* mmap.c: Unionfs doesn't filter data.
+
+	* vm_area.c: No data filtering.
+
+2004-03-02  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* main.c: Updated parsing code so that dirs can be specified as
+	b0=rw,b1,b2=ro,b3.  Defaults to rw.  Need to actually integrate
+	the permission checking code elsewhere.
+
+2003-11-10  Harikesavan Pathangi Krishnan  <hari@a-rh72i.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* file.c (unionfs_readdir): Changed code to fix the NFS related bug.
+
+2003-10-27  Harikesavan Pathangi Krishnan  <hari@mooby.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* subr.c (unionfs_copyup_dentry_len): This is a modified form of
+	unionfs_copyup_dentry() that takes in the length of file to be
+	copied up. The length is useful when the file size is changed in
+	the setattr.
+
+2003-10-01  Puja Gupta  <puja@t6.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>, Jay, Mohammad.
+
+	* subr.c (unionfs_copyup_dentry): fixed copyup bug, update bstart, bend

+
+	* subr.c (create_whiteout_left_parent): Added function for
+	creating whiteout in a parent directory by a char * string.
+	(unionfs_create_parent_dir): initialize dtohd before checking and
+	changing the bstart and bend for new dentry.
+	(unionfs_copyup_dentry): removed extra dput, since fput internally
+	does that.
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_rename_whiteout): fixed to support copyup for EROFS.

+
+	* match-malloc.pl: perl script to parse log output from
+	KMALLOC/KFREE macros, and report leaks etc.
+
+2003-09-21  Mohammad Nayyer Zubair  <zubair@t1.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>, Puja, Hari, Jay.
+

+
+	* ioctls via extended attributes works.
+
+	* branchman.c (unionfs_ioctl_delbranch): Don't let people delete

+	unionfs_mkdir()). Details on this are in the updated
+	function_description.html file
+
+	preliminary cases are working as expected
+
+	Left: rename, mknod, symlink.
+
+2003-09-01  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* file.c: Add branch ioctl and trimmed unionfs_dir_fops.

+
+	* file.c: calling unionfs_copyup_file() if write() fails on the

+
+2003-08-13  Mohammad Nayyer Zubair <mzubair@ic.sunysb.edu>

+2003-07-31  Mohammad Nayyer Zubair <mzubair@ic.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* file.c: readdir/filldir's linked list converted into a hashtable
+	of size HASHTABLE_SIZE Duplicate elimation is working. Still to
+	test the gcc tarball.
+
+	* unionfs.h: converted dir_list list head to an array of list
+	heads of size HASHTABLE_SIZE
+
+
+2003-07-30  Puja Gupta <pugupta@cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* unionfs.h: changed to new flag, CREATE_RW_ERR, UNLINK_WHITEOUT,
+	UNLINK_ERR.  Function definition for unionfs_partial_lookup.
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_partial_lookup): added, called from
+	unlink. Looks up the remaining files that were not looked up in
+	unionfs_lookup.
+	(unionfs_unlink): code now transferred to unionfs_partial_lookup.
+	(unionfs_create): flag name is CREATE_RW_ERR.
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_create): changed to new flag values.
+
+	* unionfs.h (IS_SET): changed flags to be exclusive. Also, changed
+	IS_SET to work on place value of bit.
+
+2003-07-27  Puja Gupta <pugupta@cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* file.c (unionfs_open): removed ftohd_index(file, bindex) = NULL.
+	unionfs_getdents_callback now has file_t *.
+	(unionfs_filldir, unionfs_readdir): changed the global list_head
+	for duplicate elimination to have a list_head in private data of
+	file. So, the list of name, namelen is stored in this new
+	list_head, and compared against this.
+
+	* unionfs.h: added struct filldir_node to private data of file.
+	Thus, every file has unique and seperate list for readdir.
+
+	* doit.sh: "flag=" instead of "flags=".
+
+2003-07-28  Mohammad Nayyer Zubair <mzubair@ic.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* inode.c: unionfs_link's option 1 done. Return -EXDEV if old and
+	new dentries are in different branches / starting option 2: if
+	different branches, creating destination path in the source branch
+
+	* unionfs.h: added a simple function which returns the sum of all
+	the underlying inodes' nlink value
+
+	* inode.c: calling the above function wherever nlinks value was
+	being set
+
+2003-07-24  Puja Gupta  <puja@t2.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* unionfs.h: #defines for MOUNT_FLAG, CREATE_PASSUP,
+	CREATE_RW_ERR_PASSUP, CREATE_TRY_LEFT and IS_SET.
+
+	* main.c (unionfs_parse_options): parse the mount time flag and
+	initialize it.
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_create): added handling of partial errors to
+	handle various cases: 1) Try to Left (default), 2) PassUp, 3) If
+	EPERM on RW branch, PassUp.
+
+	* doit.sh: changed mount options to include "flag=".
+
+2003-07-24  Puja Gupta  <pugupta@cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_setattr): added check for NULL hidden dentry.
+	(unionfs_inode_revalidate): added ASSERT2 for inode.
+
+2003-07-24  Mohammad Nayyer Zubair <mzubair@ic.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* file.c: in unionfs_open, now only opening leftmost file instead
+	of opening all of the hidden files.  Opening all directories
+	though.
+
+	* inode.c: setattr function done. Assigning 'correct' value to the
+	n_links variable in the unionfs inode.  In inode_revalidate
+	function assigning 'correct' value to the n_links variable in the
+	unionfs inode.
+
+	* main.c: just moved sum_nlinks variable to the beginning of the
+	  interpose function. diff -ru on a randomly distributed
+	  (recursive) gcc tarball is failing. Some duplicate files are
+	  being listed.  'ls' on the directory containing above duplicate
+	  files also lists the files twice. Files have same unionfs inode.
+	  Checking out whats happening.
+
+2003-07-22  Mohammad Nayyer Zubair <mzubair@ic.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* main.c: in interpose() added lines which compute the sum of the
+	nlinks of the underlying inodes and assigns this sum to the
+	unionfs inode.
+
+	* inode.c: in permission() added check for a null hidden inode
+
+2003-07-22  Puja Gupta <pugupta@cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* unionfs.h: init_file_array is now init_ftohf_ptr,
+	init_inode_array is now init_itohi_ptr, init_sb_array is now
+	init_stohs_ptr, added init_stohiddenmnt_ptr, init_dentry_info,
+	init_dentry_array is now init_dtohd_ptr.  All this makes sure that
+	all allocated memory is initialized to zero before its being used.
+
+	* super.c (unionfs_read_inode): init_inode_array is now init_itohi_ptr.
+
+	* main.c (unionfs_parse_options): init_priv_inode is now
+	init_dentry_info.
+	(unionfs_parse_options): memset, init_stohs_ptr, init_stohiddenmnt_ptr
+	added for initialize memory allocated to NULL.
+	(unionfs_read_super): init_dtohd_ptr added to initialize to NULL.
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_lookup): init_dentry_array is now init_dtohd_ptr.
+
+	* file.c (unionfs_open): added init_ftohf_ptr, setting underlying
+	file pointer to NULL.
+
+2003-07-21  Puja Gupta <pugupta@cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_create): get rid of the hidden dentry that lead
+	to an unsuccessful attempt to create. Update bstart, bend
+	accordingly.
+	(unionfs_create_parent_dir): added "count--" for proper pointer
+	position. Updated private data, bstart for the dentry and inode of
+	intermediate directories created.  Also, updated bend for the
+	negative dentry returned from this function to create.
+
+	* main.c (unionfs_interpose): removed comments and extra line
+	spaces.
+
+2003-07-20  Puja Gupta  <puja@idol.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* unionfs.h (MAX_DIR_CREATE): added MAX_DIR_CREATE for the number of
+	directories allowed to be created in recursive subdir creation.
+	Should be dynamic.
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_create): changed to handle partial error by
+	recursively creating directory to left branches.
+	(unionfs_create_parent_dir): added this function, it creates
+	hidden directory path for a given parent inode and dentry in
+	specified branch. (Still to test)
+
+2003-07-15  Mohammad Nayyer Zubair <mzubair@ic.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* inode.c <unionfs_lookup>: Found a bug while mounting unionfs on
+	a randomly distributed (recursive) am-utils tarball on 5 branches.
+	Basically we were not memsetting the array of pointers to hidden
+	objects after kmallocing a CUR_MAX_BRANCH number of pointers for
+	dentry, inode, file and sb.  They were assumed to be NULL in
+	lookup and hence were not explicitly set to NULL in the array when
+	requireed.
+
+	* unionfs.h: Added macros which initialize hidden arrays to NULL
+
+2003-07-15  Puja Gupta  <puja@mooby.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_lookup): added few debug statements.
+	(unionfs_unlink): Since lookup for file had just the leftmost
+	entry, unlink now internally calls lookup for all remaining
+	branches.  And the current policy for unlink is, unlink
+	all. (Tested).
+
+	* unionfs.h: added definition for unionfs_reinterpose.
+
+	* main.c (unionfs_reinterpose): This new function takes a dentry
+	with leftmost hidden inode interposed, and reinterposes the newly
+	lookedup hidden inodes in remaining branches.  Called from
+	unionfs_unlink.
+
+	* mount_tarball.sh, mount_tarball_random.sh: These scripts are now
+	moved to ../tools directory.
+
+2003-07-13  Puja Gupta  <puja@mooby.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* inode.c (unionfs_lookup): fixed initialization of negative dentry.
+
+	* print.c (fist_print_inode), (fist_print_file),(fist_print_dentry),
+	(fist_print_sb): made more readable, pointers now printed with %p.
+
+2003-07-10  Puja Gupta  <puja@idol.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* super.c (unionfs_statfs): check for duplicate superblock data being
+	added.
+	(unionfs_umount_begin): check for NULL hidden_sb, hidden_sb->s_op.
+
+2003-07-10 Mohammad Nayyer Zubair <mzubair@ic.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* print.c: fist_print_inode(): prints underlying inodes if any.
+	fist_print_dentry(): prints underlying dentries if any.
+	fist_print_files(): prints underlying files if any.
+	fist_print_superblock(): prints underlying sbs if any.
+
+2003-07-10 Mohammad Nayyer Zubair <mzubair@ic.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* print.c: improved the formatting of printing inode, dentry and
+	sb
+
+	* main.c, inode.c removed unneccessary lines printing debugging
+	info in interpose()
+
+2003-07-13 Mohammad Nayyer Zubair <mzubair@ic.sunysb.edu>
+
+	* file.c inode.c: removed debugging info lines
+
+	* created mount_tarball.sh.  right now, distributes an equal
+		number of files/dirs among N branches tar-ing am-utils
+		through unionfs mount point gives same package buildall
+		through mount point gives same structure/files

+To build Unionfs, there are two main components:
+
+-  unionfs.ko: the kernel module in 2.6
+
+-  unionctl: a user utility which allows you to add and remove branches
+
+You should be able to just type "make" and Unionfs will build itself for the
+running kernel.  The Makefile will look for your running kernel sources in
+/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/include.
+
+If your kernel sources are located in a different directory, create a
+"fistdev.mk" file along the lines of:
+LINUXSRC=/path/to/my/kernel/sources/linux-2.6.xx
+TOPINC=-I$(LINUXSRC)/include
+MODDIR=/lib/modules/2.6.xx
+
+LINUXSRC points to the root of a Linux source tree.  TOPINC should point to
+that tree's include directory.  Finally, the module will be copied to
+$MODDIR/kernel/fs/unionfs.ko.
+
+You must set all three variables together, otherwise you can have problems
+compiling, installing, or loading the module.
+
+You also need to have the headers for e2fsprogs installed, on Red Hat
+derived systems (like Fedora Core), this means that you need to have
+e2fsprogs-devel installed.
+
+There are two Makefile options related to extended attribute support,
+which is turned off by default.  You should define UNIONFS_XATTR to turn
+it on.  Vanilla kernels should work automatically, but if you (or your
+vendor) has applied the ACL/EA patches you might need to define
+FIST_SETXATTR_CONSTVOID to correct the setxattr operation's function
+prototype.
+
+Using fistdev.mk, you can also turn off the debugging print system,
+which adds to the modules code size significantly.  Just add
+"EXTRACFLAGS=-DUNIONFS_NDEBUG" to fistdev.mk.
+
+The doit.sh script included in the distribution will mount unionfs
+with two branches (/branch0 and /branch1) by default.  You can use it
+as an example and edit to your tastes.
+
+To install unionfs run "make install".  This copies unionfs.o into
+/lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/fs/; copies the utilities into
+/usr/local/sbin; and copies man pages into /usr/local/man;
+
+fistdev.mk summary:
+UNIONFS_OPT_CFLAG	By default -O2.  If you want a different optimization
+			level change this variable.
+UNIONFS_DEBUG_CFLAG	By default -g.  If you want to remove debug, set
+			this variable to nothing.  This will result in a
+			smaller (but harder to debug) Unionfs.
+EXTRACFLAGS		Additional stuff to pass to the compiler, this
+			is useful when combined with the definitions below.
+			(e.g., EXTRACFLAGS=-DUNIONFS_NDEBUG to turn off
+			debugging).
+LINUXSRC		Where to find the kernel build directory.
+TOPINC			Where to find the kernel headers.
+PREFIX			Where to install Unionfs utilities.
+			By default /usr/local.
+MODPREFIX		What is the prefix to the root directory for modules,
+			by default this is unset.  Your modules will end up
+			in /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/fs.  With
+			MODPREFIX=/foo they end up in
+			/foo/lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/fs.
+
+Define options summary:
+UNIONFS_NDEBUG		Turn off debugging facility (reduces code size).
+UNIONFS_UNSUPPORTED	Bypass kernel versions checks.
+SUPPORT_BROKEN_SETUP	Enable sendfile, which allows you to run losetup, but
+			if you try to write to a loop file, you will cause
+			an Oops.
+
+Known interactions with other kernel features/patches:
+* If you get an error like this on Fedora Core 4:
+  make: *** /lib/modules/2.6.11-1.1369_FC4/build: No such file or directory.  Stop.
+  Then you need to install the kernel-devel package.
+
+* If you get an error like this:
+  unionimap.h:9:23: uuid/uuid.h: No such file or directory
+  Followed, by more parse errors,  then you need to make sure you have
+  e2fsprogs-devel installed (or your distribution's equivalent).
+
+* Some NFS servers return -EACCES instead of -EROFS when they are exported
+  read-only.  This means that we can't legitimately determine when a user is
+  not allowed to access a file.  To enable a hack so that NFS appears to work
+  correctly (but NFS ACLs will break), mount the nfs-branch with mode nfsro.
+
+* If you want to export Unionfs over NFS, then you need to add
+  extra information to /etc/exports.  knfsd will not export Unionfs unless
+  you have an fsid option in /etc/exports.  This is because Unionfs has no
+  real device.  See man exports(5) for more information on fsid.
+
+* If you want to use Unionfs as your root file system you need to use
+  pivot_root.  www.linux-live.org provides scripts for creating live CDs with
+  Unionfs as the root.  The following commands are adapted from the linuxrc
+  from linux-live 5.0.16.  You may want to look at the original script from
+  www.linux-live.org if you are having problems.  SLAX (www.slax.org) is a
+  an actual live CD distribution based on these scripts.
+
+  UNION=/union
+  MEMORY=/memory
+  MOUNTDIR=/mnt
+  CHANGES=$MEMORY/changes
+
+  mkdir -p $UNION
+
+  mkdir -p $MEMORY
+  mount -t tmpfs tmpfs $MEMORY
+
+  mkdir -p $CHANGES
+  mount -t unionfs -o dirs=$CHANGES=rw unionfs $UNION
+
+  # Here other things are added to the Union, by using unionctl.
+
+  cd $UNION
+  mkdir -p initrd
+  pivot_root . initrd
+  exec chroot . /bin/bash
+  # You should never get here
+
+* If you want to use losetup, then you need to define -DSUPPORT_BROKEN_LOSETUP
+  You will be able to use it read-only, but when you try to use it read-write,
+  you will get an Oops.  This should eventually be fixed when we have our
+  own address-space operations (so that we can support sendfile).
+
+* Selinux requires extended attributes (but has not been tested by us).
+  You should compile Unionfs with Extended Attribute support by adding
+  EXTRACFLAGS=-DUNIONFS_XATTR to fistdev.mk.  After this, you can follow
+  the following instructions are from Jaspreet Singh:
+
+  1. Install strict/targetted selinux policy sources
+  2. Open /etc/selinux/<policy_type>/src/policy/fs_use
+  3. Append "fs_use_xattr unionfs system_u:object_r:fs_t;"
+  4. Compile, install, and reload the selinux policy
+
+  "There were a couple of issues with Unionfs but they were minor."
+
+* tmpfs does not support fsyncing directories, so if you have a Union with
+  tmpfs as the leftmost branch, fsync returns EINVAL.
+
+Other known limitations:
+* Unionfs does not provide cache coherency.  What this means to you is that
+  if you directly modify the lower-level branches, then Unionfs will get
+  confused.  You can tell Unionfs to throw out its cache and recreate all
+  of its objects (lazily), by running "uniondbg -g UNION".
+
+  It is especially dangerous to create or remove whiteouts from underneath
+  Unionfs, as there are several places where it ASSERTs on invariants
+  that must be true (e.g., if the file exists, the whiteout should not and
+  vice versa).
+
+* Unionfs doesn't support sendfile.  This often manifests itself as apache
+  serving zero length files.  You can turn off sendfile n Apache with the
+  EnableSendfile httpd.conf directive (see
+  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html).   This is also the reason
+  that losetup is unsupported, Unionfs needs its own address space operations
+  otherwise upper and lower-level files and pages get mixed and matched.
+
+* If you restart an NFS server, you will get ESTALE errors on the client
+  because Unionfs does not have persistent inode numbers.  You should also
+  consider NFS over TCP, so lost packets don't cause readdir to get confused.
+
+* Renaming a directory on a read-only branch returns an EXDEV error.  The "mv"
+  utility is designed to handle this error (at least GNU coreutils and busybox
+  will handle this correctly), so a user will not see anything.  The only
+  issue will be applications that internally rename a directory, but do not
+  properly handle EXDEV (which is really a bug on the application's part).
+
+* The documentation needs to improve
+
+* The object code is much larger than it could be, but this can be solved by
+  enabling UNIONFS_NDEBUG and setting UNIONFS_DEBUG_CFLAG to the empty string.
+
+Integrating Unionfs into a 2.6 kernel source tree (2.4 is not supported):
+1. First run patch-kernel.sh included with Unionfs. Its first argument is the
+   path to your kernel source tree.
+2. Configure and compile your kernel as you normally would.   Unionfs is at the
+   bottom of the the File systems -> Miscellaenous filesystems menu.
+3. To install the Unionfs utilities (i.e., unionctl and uniondbg), run
+   "make utils install-utils" from the Unionfs source directory.
+4. Boot into your new kernel, and enjoy Unionfs.

+- Removed excess 2.4 code (Unionfs 1.1.0 is for 2.6 only)
+- Removed file locking code, as the VFS does a better job of it.
+- Fixed off by one errors when kmallocing names in inode.c.
+- Fixed several deadlock bugs.
+- Fixed several rename and rmdir bugs.
+- Permissions checked on files that are on read-only file systems
+- AMD64 fix for compiling on gentoo.
+- Properly update generation when we combine copyup and reopening.
+- Cleanedup Makefile to remove 2.4 clutter.
+- Added documentation for the MODDIR option in the INSTALL file.
+
+* Unionfs 1.0.14
+Features:
+- Dropped unmaintained setattr,diropaque,delete=first and mount flags
+- Updated unionfs.4 to reflect default mount modes
+- You can use the root of the Union to remove branches with unionctl
+- Use official Debian packaging files.
+- Linux 2.6.13 support.
+
+Bug fixes:
+- Fixed several dentry refcount bugs introduced by new deletion framework.
+- Fixed uninitialized fd_set in the query ioctl.
+- Branch reference counting now works across insertion and removal of branches.
+  This prevents the branch counts from getting "confused".
+- Handle "/" as a branch in unionctl.
+- Removed static buffer for debug prints in favor of vprintk.
+- NFS silly renames avoided during several cases.
+- Attempting a write lock causes a copyup, so that the underying flock will
+  work.
+- Cleaned up mount option parsing.
+- Improved link counting for directories.
+
+* Unionfs 1.0.13
+- Unionfs now handles deleting an open file (and several other deletion fixes).
+  Thanks to the Knoppix people and Tomas Matejicek for finding these bugs.
+- The NODEBUG flag has been renamed to UNIONFS_NDEBUG.
+- Instead of allocating all of the lower-level pointers in dentries, inodes
+  and files, we have a fixed number of them preallocated and malloc only if
+  we exceed that number.
+- Fixed a dentry reference count bug with UNIONFS_NDEBUG.
+- Support for persistent inode numbers across mounts.
+- Added a "which-branch" ioctl and corresponding --query to unionctl, so that
+  it is possible to find out where a file or directory is coming from.
+- In 2.6.11 and onwards, don't take the BKL for ioctls.
+
+* Unionfs 1.0.12
+- Copy-up is delayed until a write operation occurs, so spurious copy-ups are
+  avoided.
+- Improved copyup UID spoofing for mkdir
+- Instructions and shell script for compiling Unionfs into a monolothic kernel.
+- Added support for opaque directories, which mask the contents of
+  lower-priority directories.  This makes recreating a removed directory an
+  O(1)  operation instead of an O(n) operation, and also makes subsequent
+  operations faster.  There were also several whiteout related fixes bundled
+  in here.
+- Fixed bug with whiteouts on Reiserfs
+- Fixed bug when a file transitioned from a negative dentry to a positive
+  dentry (i.e., if you add a branch that inserts a file you previously
+  looked up, but did not exist)
+- Fixed return code for extended attribute functions
+- amd64 compile fixes
+- Extended attribute copy-up
+- Unionfs returns EXDEV instead of copying up a directory on move, this
+  fixes a bug where Unionfs would "forget" the contents of a copied up
+  directory after unmount.
+- Fix for following symlinks
+- Improved print routines (separated generic from unionfs printing routines)
+- INSTALL has some instructions for using Unionfs as a root file system and
+  also for using Unionfs with Selinux.
+- Dentry private data uses a separate kmem_cache and inodes in 2.6 use their
+  own kmem_cache.  This should improve performance a bit because there are
+  fewer individual memory allocations (and less wasted space).
+
+* Unionfs 1.0.11
+This release fixes NFS exporting which was broken in 1.0.10.
+- f_pos and lseek's offsets are unified, so readdir works on NFS exported
+  unionfs mounts again.
+
+* Unionfs 1.0.10
+This release fixes several bugs over 1.0.9, but it will not correctly work if
+you want to NFS export it.  For that you need to use 1.0.9 on 2.4.  In 1.0.11,
+we will fix NFS exports correctly.
+
+- Don't d_delete entries that don't have positive refcounts (Fabian Franz)
+- Hardlinks should point to the same inode (Fabian Franz)
+- File locking works correctly.
+- Improved directory llseeking.

+- We no longer require hacked copies of vfs_create and vfs_unlink
+- Moved finding and adding filldir_nodes into rdstate.c

+  now includes tests to make sure linking on a read only filesystem works.
+- Fixed an issue where unionfs_dir_llseek would cause an Oops
+
+* Unionfs 1.0.8
+- Fixed bug with readdir (but oddly not ls) that prevented that last entry
+  from being shown.
+- Include INSTALL file with information about installing Unionfs.
+- Fix unionctl bug with "/" as the path to search for
+- Fix to copyup permissions on directories
+- Allow llseek to current directory position, but no others
+
+* Unionfs 1.0.7
+- Fixed locking for readdir state, this fixes a kernel Oops on preemptive
+  kernels, and deadlocks on SMP kernels.
+- Prevent readdir from giving -ESTALE on last entry.
+- Fixes for gcc 2.9.5 (Alex de Landegraaf)
+- Debian package scripts (Alex de Landegraaf)
+- NFS Export on 2.6 (Sai Suman)
+- Copyup permissions fix (Sai Suman)
+- Warn when compiling on unsupported kernels (<2.6.9 or <2.4.20)
+- Improved hardlink support (but not quite there yet)
+
+* Unionfs 1.0.6
+A lot of code has changed in the 1.0.6 release, so it may not be as stable as
+the 1.0.5 release.
+
+- Makefile fix over 1.0.5 for install target on 2.6
+- unionfs.h, fist.h Makefile dependency fixed
+- Support for readdir over NFS
+- Hash table sizes are now based on the size of the lower-level directory
+- In 2.4 inode private data resides in the inode.u field, saving memory
+- Use kmem caches for filldir nodes rather than wasting space with extra
+  large kmallocs, also move short names inline
+
+* Unionfs 1.0.5
+- Support for both 2.6 and 2.4 kernels
+
+* Unionfs 1.0.4
+- Copyup now correctly handles directories, devices, and symlinks.
+- Extended attributes are now off by default because they cause too many
+  compile problems.
+- The regression tests is now included in the release, but is not actually
+  installed.  These tests are rather primitive, but do check some fundamental
+  Unionfs behavior on multiple branches.
+
+* Unionfs 1.0.3
+- Compile fixes for older (and newer) compilers than found on Redhat 9.
+- Compile fixes for older kernels.
+- Don't Oops when passed bad directories.
+
+* Unionfs 1.0.2
+- Minor README updates
+
+* Unionfs 1.0.1
+- Fix to release target which includes manual pages.
+
+* Unionfs 1.0
+- First public release

+
+We're pleased to announce the first release of a unioning file system
+for Linux, called Unionfs.  To download software and documentation,
+see
+
+	http://www.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu/project-unionfs.html
+
+Unionfs is a stackable unification file system, which can appear to
+merge the contents of several directories (branches), while keeping
+their physical content separate.  Unionfs is useful for unified source
+tree management, merged contents of split CD-ROM, merged separate
+software package directories, data grids, and more.  Unionfs allows
+any mix of read-only and read-write branches, as well as insertion and
+deletion of branches anywhere in the fan-out.  To maintain Unix
+semantics, Unionfs handles elimination of duplicates, partial-error
+conditions, and more.  This release also includes additional
+preliminary features that were specifically designed for security
+applications, such as snapshotting and sandboxing.
+
+This Unionfs release has been tested with recent 2.4 and 2.6 kernels.
+For the 2.4 kernels, the minimum requirement is 2.4.20.  For 2.6
+kernels, the minimum requirement is 2.6.11.  You also need to have the
+development headers for e2fsprogs installed.
+
+Unionfs is released under the GPL (see the COPYING file in the
+distribution for details).
+
+For more information on using Unionfs, download the tarball and see
+the following man pages:
+
+- unionfs.4:  Describes how to mount unionfs
+
+- unionctl.8: Describes how to control an already mounted Union
+
+For more information about Unionfs internals (which we think are
+really cool :-), see the following technical report at the above Web
+site:
+
+  C. P. Wright, J. Dave, P. Gupta, H. Krishnan, E. Zadok, and M. Zubair
+  "Versatility and Unix Semantics in a Fan-Out Unification File System"
+  Technical Report FSL-04-01b, October 2004
+  Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University
+  http://www.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu/docs/unionfs-tr/unionfs.pdf
+
+In addition, you can find an article in Linux Journal (December 2004
+issue) titled "Unionfs: Bringing File Systems Together."  It is available
+online at http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7714.
+
+See the INSTALL file for instructions on building Unionfs, iteractions with
+kernel features, and known bugs and limitations.
+
+To report bugs, please email them to the "fistgen@filesystems.org"
+list (see www.filesystems.org), or submit them via Bugzilla to
+https://bugzilla.filesystems.org/.  But reports with fixes are most
+welcome.
+
+Enjoy,
+Erez and Charles (on behalf of the Unionfs team)

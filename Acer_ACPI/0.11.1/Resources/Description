[Name] Acer_ACPI
[Summary] A Linux kernel module to allow control of some of the hardware on
later model Acer laptops
[Description] acer_acpi is a driver to allow you to control various aspects
of your Acer laptop hardware using the proc filesystem.  It was originally
developed by Mark Smith, in order to activate the wireless LAN card under a
64-bit version of Linux, as acerhk[1] (the previous fine solution to the
problem) relied on making BIOS calls which are not allowed from a 64-bit OS.

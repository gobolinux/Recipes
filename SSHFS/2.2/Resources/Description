[Name] SSHFS
[Summary] Filesystem client based on SSH File Transfer Protocol
[Description] SSHFS  is a filesystem client based on the SSH File
Transfer Protocol. Since most SSH servers already support this
protocol it is very easy to set up: i.e. on the server side there's
nothing to do. On the client side mounting the filesystem is as easy
as logging into the server with ssh. 
sshfs is based on FUSE (userspace filesystem framework for Linux),
thus you will have to prepare fuse kernel module to be able to use it.

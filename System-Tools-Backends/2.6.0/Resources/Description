[Name] System-Tools-Backends
[Summary] Tools to manage system configuration
[Description] The System Tools Backends (s-t-b for short) are a set of
cross-platform modules for Linux, FreeBSD and other Unix systems. The
backends provide an common DBus interface to all platforms to modify
or read the system configuration in a distro independent fashion.
Historically, access to system configuration has varied deeply across
Unix flavours, and concreting a bit more, across Linux distributions,
making it near impossible to write desktop tools that could work
flawlessly in a cross-platform way. System Tools Backends try to fill
this gap, offering a generic and easy way for desktop applications to
read and modify configuration details.

Right now the System Tools Backends fully support various distros/OS
such as: Redhat, Mandrake, SuSE, Fedora, Debian (and derivations like
Ubuntu, Linex, Guadalinex...), Gentoo, Slackware, FreeBSD, Solaris,

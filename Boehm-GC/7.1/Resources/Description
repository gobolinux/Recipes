[Name] Boehm-GC
[Summary] A garbage collector for C and C++
[Description] The Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector can 
be used as a garbage collecting replacement for C malloc or C++ new. It 
allows you to allocate memory basically as you normally would, without 
explicitly deallocating memory that is no longer useful. The collector 
automatically recycles memory when it determines that it can no longer 
be otherwise accessed.

[Description] The popt library exists essentially for parsing 
command line options. Some specific 
advantages of popt are no global variables 
(allowing multiple passes in parsing argv), 
parsing an arbitrary array of argv-style 
elements (allowing parsing of command-line-
strings from any source), a standard method 
of option aliasing, ability to exec external 
option filters, and automatica generation of 
help and usage messages.

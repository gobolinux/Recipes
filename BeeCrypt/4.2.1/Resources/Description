[Name] BeeCrypt
[Summary] A library of cryptographic algorithms
[Description] 
BeeCrypt is an open source cryptography library that contains
highly optimized C and assembler implementations of many well-known
algorithms including Blowfish, SHA-1, Diffie-Hellman, and ElGamal.

Unlike some other crypto libraries, BeeCrypt is not designed to
solve one specific problem, like file encryption, but to be a
general purpose toolkit which can be used in a variety of
applications.

There are also no patent or royalty issues associated with
BeeCrypt, and it is released under the GNU LGPL license, which
means it can be used for free in both open source and closed
source commercial projects.

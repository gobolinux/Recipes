# Note: This is only a way of compiling all XFCE4 parts with one single command.
# It's not a Meta recipe. All XFCE parts will be compiled separately, and can be updated individually.
# The "url" above is just a dummy -- the Compile tool would not allow to make the recipe without it.
# What really matters in this recipe is its Dependencies list, 
# that includes all recipes needed to have a full XFCE build. (Hugo Barrocas)

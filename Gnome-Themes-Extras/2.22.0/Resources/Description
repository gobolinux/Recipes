[Summary] Extra themes and icon files for GNOME Desktop Environment
[Description] This package contains a few nice contributed themes for
the GNOME desktop, including vector icons for applications and
nautilus, GTK+ themes and metacity themes. 

 * The Amaranth theme brings a look of shiny silver.
 * The Gorilla theme is built around Jimmac's famous yellow icons.
 * The Lush theme looks like Mandrake Linux's Galaxy theme.
 * The Nuvola theme is an adaptation of David Vignoni's "blue style
   surf" theme.
 * The SphereCrystal theme provides a blue desktop with an aquatic
   design.
 * The Wasp theme makes the GNOME desktop look like the BeOS system.

[Summary] A Pattern Matching Utility for Convenient Text Extraction
[Description] Txr is an interpreter for a query language (the "txr language"). A txr query matches text and extracts pieces by binding them to variables that are embedded in the query. Txr can output the raw bindings gathered from the data, or substitute them into a template-driven report.

[Name] GVFS 
[Summary] Userspace virtual filesystem 
[Description] gvfs is a userspace virtual filesystem designed to work
with the i/o abstractions of gio (a library availible in glib >=
2.15.1). It installs several modules that are automatically used by
applications using the APIs of libgio. There is also fuse support that
allows applications not using gio to access the gvfs filesystems.

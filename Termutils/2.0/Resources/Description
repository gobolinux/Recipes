[Name] Termutils
[Summary] Provides 'tput' and 'tabs' executables
[Description] The `tput' command allows shell scripts to do things like clear
the screen, underline text, and center text no matter how wide the screen is.
To do these things, it translates the terminal-independent name of a terminal
capability into its actual value for the terminal type being used.

`tabs' is a program to set hardware terminal tab settings.

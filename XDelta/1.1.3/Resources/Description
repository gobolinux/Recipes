[Description] Xdelta is a complete system for managing delta-compressed storage and network transport. Using the Xdelta system, you can easily incorporate this functionality into your application. The system offers improvements over the use of RCS for back-end delta-compressed storage, common in version control systems, and also provides primitive support for delta-compressed transport in a manner similar to CVSup.

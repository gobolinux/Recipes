[Summary] An ASCII art gfx library.
[License] GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)
[Description] AA-lib is a low level gfx library just as many
other libraries are. The main difference is that
AA-lib does not require graphics device. In fact,
there is no graphical output possible. AA-lib
replaces those old-fashioned output methods with a
powerful ASCII art renderer. The API is designed
to be similar to other graphics libraries.

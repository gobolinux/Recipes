[Description] dave's cd player (dcd) is a simple command-line CD player. It plays CDs, loops (sequences of) tracks, plays tracks at random, and so on. Its a full featured, but simple-to-use CD player. It supports libmusicbrainz (musicbrainz.org) for CD information if desired, yet remains one of the leanest CD players out there.

[Name] ThirdPartyInstallers
[Summary] Utilities to install packages in RPM and DEB on GoboLinux.
[Description] This is a collection of utilities to handle the installation of packages in non-native formats such as RPM and DEB.

Packages are unpacked under /Programs. The contents of /opt, when present, are flattened under the new program entry and compatibility symlinks are created at /opt pointing back to the new entry at /Programs.

Note that running packages built for other distributions is a best-effort task. There are many features that won't work out of the box and that are outside the scope of ThirdPartyInstallers. For instance, init scripts, tasks files, and reliance on other distro-specific components may preclude the installed package from working as expected.

ThirdPartyInstallers should help you to install distro-agnostic packages such as LibreOffice, self-contained packages, and packages that do have many fancy dependencies. It will not work with complex packages such as KDE.

If there is a GoboLinux recipe to build a program for which you have an RPM/DEB file, please use the Compile tool instead of the ThirdPartyInstallers utilities. We provide zero support for third-party packages.

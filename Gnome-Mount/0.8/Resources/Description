[Name] Gnome-Mount
[Summary] Applications for mounting, unmounting and ejecting storage devices.
[Description] The gnome-mount package contains programs for mounting, unmounting and ejecting storage devices.
All the gnome-mount programs utilize the methods on HAL and as such run unprivileged. The rationale for gnome-mount is to have a centralized place (in GConf) where settings (e.g. mount options and mount locations) are maintained. 
A nautilus extension allows to easily change the mount options which can be user, drive or volume specific.

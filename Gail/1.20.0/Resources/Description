[Summary] Accessibility support for GTK+ and libgnomecanvas
[Description] GAIL is a GTK+ module that provides accessibility support for GTK+ and libgnomecanvas by implementing AtkObjects for widgets in the two libraries. For example, if the module is loaded in a program which calls gtk_widget_get_accessible() for a GtkEntry, an instance of GailEntry is returned. This module is normally used with the atk-bridge GTK+ module from at-spi to allow an assistive technology, e.g a screenreader, to query or drive the program.

[Description] GNU VCDImager is a program for making Video CD (and Super Video CD, a.k.a. SVCD) images out of MPEG movie files. The images it creates are ready to use with programs which understand BIN/CUE images, such as cdrdao. GNU VCDRip allows for reversing the process, ripping mpeg tracks from (Super) Video CDs.

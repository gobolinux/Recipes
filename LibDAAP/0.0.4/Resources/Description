[Name] LibDAAP
[Summary] Digital Audio Access Protocol library
[Description] The Digital Audio Access Protocol, or DAAP, is used by Apple's iTunes 4.0 digital audio player to share music across a network or the Internet. It provides capability not only to stream audio from one computer to another, but also to list the host's playlists so that they can be accessed remotely.
This project's aim is to completely document the protocol (until official documentation becomes available) and to provide a working, open source, client and server implementation that is compatible with iTunes. That way, any application developer can use the protocol within their own software creations.

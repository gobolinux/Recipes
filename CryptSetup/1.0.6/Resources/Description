[Description] CryptSetup provides commands to create and manage encrypted partitions. LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) for dm-crypt is implemented in cryptsetup, as well as the old non-LUKS dm-crypt mapping. Formerly named cryptsetup-luks, it has now replaced the old, original "cryptsetup".  It provides all the functionality of the original version plus all LUKS features, that are accesible by luks* action.

[Description] xCHM is a graphical CHM viewer for UNIX. It's
based on CHMLIB and written with wxGTK. It is able
to display the topics tree, work with displayed
pages history, print the current page, work with
bookmarks, change fonts and fast search through
all the pages of the loaded .chm document. Being
indirectly dependent on GTK+, the possibility of
changing GTK+ skins makes xCHM theme-friendly.

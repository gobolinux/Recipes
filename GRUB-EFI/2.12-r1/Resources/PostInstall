Warning! This revision introduces breaking changes from Gobo 017.01 to 
Gobo 017.01-r1. 

The ESP's mount point has been moved from `/System/Kernel/Boot/efi` to
`/System/Kernel/ESP`. 

The grub boot-directory too has been moved from `/System/Kernel/Boot/grub`
into the ESP partition at `/System/Kernel/ESP/grub`. This includes grub.cfg,
themes, fonts, locales etc.

Legacy BIOS booting is unaffected.

[Name] GForth
[Summary] GNU Forth interpreter
[License] GPL V3
[Description] GNU Forth interpreter that is ANSI compliant.  NOTE: If you Compile or otherwise install the Ffcall package, GForth will also have the ability to call libraries of C software.  Ffcall must be installed first in order for GForth to detect this, however.  However, GForth can run on its own without Ffcall.  For this reason, Ffcall is not listed as a dependency.
